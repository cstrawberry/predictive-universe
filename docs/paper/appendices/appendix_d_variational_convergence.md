# Appendix D: Variational Perspective and Dynamical Convergence to Alignment & Regularity

## D.1 Introduction: Optimization Landscape and Convergence

This Appendix develops the variational perspective on the Predictive Universe (PU) framework's dynamics, providing rigorous dynamical justifications for two cornerstone results presented in the main text:
1.  **Theorem 2 (Dynamically Enforced Functional Correspondence):** Demonstrating that the operational complexity proxy $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$ aligns with the theoretical Predictive Physical Complexity $C_P(v)$ at viable equilibria.
2.  **Theorem 43 (Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity):** Showing that the adaptation dynamics converge almost surely to configurations exhibiting geometric regularity, complementing the necessity argument in Appendix C.

We introduce the **Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) Potential $V(x)$**, an effective potential function derived from the framework's core principles (Axiom 1: POP, Definition 15: PCE). The system's slow adaptation dynamics, governing the evolution of the network configuration $x(t)$ (including network structure and local complexities), are modeled as a stochastic gradient flow on the landscape defined by $V(x)$. By analyzing the structure of $V(x)$ and the properties of this stochastic process, we prove that the dynamics robustly drive the system towards configurations that simultaneously exhibit complexity alignment and geometric regularity. This establishes these properties not as assumptions, but as necessary consequences of the fundamental optimization processes governing the MPU network.

## D.2 The Instantaneous PCE Potential ($V(x)$)

The PCE principle mandates that the MPU network seeks configurations $x$ that optimize the trade-off between maximizing predictive utility (Benefit) and minimizing comprehensive costs (Operational, Propagation, Adaptation). The PCE Potential $V(x)$ quantifies this trade-off, such that configurations minimizing $V(x)$ correspond to the PCE-optimal states. $V(x)$ represents the effective potential governing the *slow* adaptation dynamics of the network configuration $x(t)$, encompassing network structure $\mathcal{N}(t)$, local MPU complexities $\{C_v(t) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x(t)}\}$, and related macroscopic variables influencing costs and benefits.

**Definition D.1 (Structure of the PCE Potential $V(x)$).** Let $x$ represent the complete configuration state of the MPU network within the admissible state space $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$. The effective PCE Potential $V(x)$, representing the net cost rate the system seeks to minimize under its operational dynamics, is constructed as:
$$
V(x) = V_{op}(x) + V_{prop}(x) - V_{benefit}(x) + V_{penalty}(x)
\quad \text{(D.1)}
$$
where:
* Â  **$V_{prop}(x) = \sum_{(u,v)} \langle \Phi(w_{uv}) \rangle_{\rho(x)}$**: The total expected propagation cost rate. This term represents the resources needed to maintain predictive coherence across the network. The cost function $\Phi(w_{uv})$ for a link $(u,v)$ is fundamentally information-theoretic: it scales with the rate of information required to be sent across the link to maintain coherence, penalized by the link's finite channel capacity $C_{max}$ (derived from ND-RID limits in Appendix E). Irregular network geometries (as analyzed in Appendix C) increase path lengths and decrease effective channel fidelity, thus quantitatively increasing $V_{prop}$. A concrete example of this principle is used in Appendix G.8 to model the communication cost of maintaining gauge field coherence (see Eq. G.8.5).
*   **$V_{prop}(x) = \sum_{(u,v)} \langle \Phi(w_{uv}) \rangle_{\rho(x)}$**: The total expected propagation cost rate. $\Phi(w_{uv})$ is an effective cost function associated with maintaining and utilizing the network link $(u,v)$ with weight $w_{uv}$ (related to ND-RID fidelity $f_{RID}$ and cost $\varepsilon$, cf. Definition 35). This represents the cost of maintaining network coherence and communication infrastructure.
*   **$V_{benefit}(x) = \sum_{v} \Gamma_0 B(PP_v(x))$**: The total effective power-equivalent predictive benefit derived from the network's performance. $PP_v(x)$ is the local Predictive Performance (Definition 7) of MPU $v$ in configuration $x$, dependent on $C_v = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_x$ and the local effective target complexity $\hat{C}_{target}(v, x)$ via the Law of Prediction (Theorem 19, Equation 22). $B(PP)$ is a monotonically increasing benefit function (e.g., $B(PP) = PP$ or related to reduction in prediction error), and $\Gamma_0$ is the power conversion factor (Definition 20).
*   **$V_{penalty}(x)$**: Represents effective penalty terms implicitly required for the consistency of the framework. As derived below (Sections D.3, D.4), self-consistent optimization requires that the structure of $V(x)$ effectively incorporates terms equivalent to penalties for complexity misalignment ($V_{proxy}$) and geometric irregularity ($V_{geom}$).

The potential $V(x)$ is assumed to be continuously differentiable ($C^1$) with respect to the relevant components of configuration $x$ within $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$, and bounded below. The system's adaptation dynamics aim to minimize this operational potential $V(x)$.

## D.3 Dynamic Complexity Alignment Mechanism ($C_P \leftrightarrow \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$)

This section provides the rigorous justification for Theorem 2, demonstrating that the operational complexity proxy $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$ is dynamically driven into alignment with the theoretical Predictive Physical Complexity $C_P(v)$ at stable equilibrium points.

**Lemma D.1 (True PCE Optimality Requires Alignment).**
Let $V_{true}(x; \{C_P(v)\})$ denote the hypothetical "true" PCE potential, calculated identically to $V(x)$ but using the theoretical complexities $C_P(v)$ and their associated true physical costs $R(C_P(v))$, $R_I(C_P(v))$ in the operational cost term. A necessary condition for a configuration $x^*$ to be a stable minimum of $V_{true}$ under the *true* physical resource constraints is that the operational complexity proxies align with the theoretical complexities: $C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*}$ for all $v$. Persistent misalignment $\delta_v = C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle \neq 0$ implies the system is operating with incorrect internal cost estimates relative to actual physical expenditure, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and thus preventing stabilization at a true PCE optimum.

*Proof.* The system's adaptation dynamics adjust variables (like $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$) based on gradients derived from the *operational* potential $V(x)$, which uses $R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle)$. However, the *actual* physical resources consumed are governed by the *true* complexities $C_P(v)$ and costs $R(C_P(v))$. If $\delta_v = C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle \neq 0$, the operational cost estimate $R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle)$ deviates from the true cost $R(C_P(v))$. Minimizing $V(x)$ based on this potentially incorrect cost estimate will lead the system towards an operational minimum $x_{op}^*$ where $\nabla_{op} V(x_{op}^*) = 0$. However, this operational minimum will generally *not* coincide with the true physical optimum $x_{true}^*$ where the gradient of the true potential $V_{true}$ vanishes, $\nabla_{true} V_{true}(x_{true}^*) = 0$, unless the operational costs accurately reflect the true costs, which (assuming $R$ is monotonic) requires $\delta_v = 0$ for all $v$. A configuration can only be a stable equilibrium under the full physics governed by PCE if it minimizes the true potential $V_{true}$. Therefore, any stable equilibrium $x^*$ must satisfy the alignment condition $\delta_v = 0$. QED

*(Note on notation: In this Lemma, we used $\nabla_{op}$ and $\nabla_{true}$ to explicitly distinguish the operational system's calculation from the underlying physical optimum. In all subsequent sections of this appendix, we revert to the shorthand $\nabla V$ to denote the gradient of the operational potential $V(x)$ that drives the system dynamics according to Eq. D.8.)*

**Corollary D.1 (Alignment Condition at Stable Equilibria).**
Any configuration $x^*$ that represents a stable equilibrium state (attractor) under the complete physical adaptation dynamics governed by the Principle of Compression Efficiency must satisfy the alignment condition $C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*}$ for all constituent MPUs $v$.

**Theorem D.1 (Implicit Alignment Penalty in Operational Potential $V(x)$).**
For the system's operational adaptation dynamics, governed by minimizing the operational potential $V(x)$ (Eq. D.1), to converge to states satisfying the true PCE optimality condition (which requires alignment per Corollary D.1), the effective operational potential $V(x)$ must behave *as if* it contains an implicit penalty term that vanishes only at alignment. The structure of the true physical costs versus the operational costs induces gradients that are functionally equivalent to those arising from adding a penalty term quadratic in the misalignment $\delta_v = C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_x$ to the core potential:
$$
V_{proxy}(x) = \frac{k_1}{2} \sum_{v} \delta_v^2 = \frac{k_1}{2} \sum_{v} \bigl(C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_x \bigr)^2
\quad \text{(D.1a)}
$$
where $k_1 > 0$ is an effective coupling constant reflecting the sensitivity of costs to misalignment. Specifically, the operational dynamics optimizing $V(x)$ must generate gradients $\nabla V$ that include the effect of $-\nabla V_{proxy}$ to dynamically drive the system towards alignment ($\delta_v = 0$).

*Proof.* The system adjusts its operational variables, including $\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle$, based on the gradient $\nabla_{\langle C_u \rangle} V(x)$. This gradient is calculated using the operational costs $R(\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle)$. However, the *physical consequences* (energy dissipation, constraint satisfaction) depend on the true costs $R(C_P(u))$. For the system to dynamically converge to a state that is optimal with respect to the *true* physics (which requires $\delta_u=0$), the operational dynamics must effectively incorporate feedback about the discrepancy between operational cost assumptions and physical reality. This feedback must generate a restoring force within the operational gradient $\nabla_{\langle C_u \rangle} V(x)$ that pushes $\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle$ towards $C_P(u)$ whenever $\delta_u \neq 0$. The simplest form for such a restoring force is proportional to $-\delta_u = C_P(u) - \langle \hat{C}_u \rangle$. This force is functionally equivalent to the negative gradient of the quadratic penalty $V_{proxy}$ with respect to $\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle$: $-\frac{1}{k_1}\nabla_{\langle C_u \rangle} V_{proxy} = C_P(u) - \langle \hat{C}_u \rangle = -\delta_u$. Therefore, for the operational dynamics based on minimizing $V(x)$ to achieve consistency with the true underlying PCE objective (requiring $\delta_u = 0$), the effective structure of $V(x)$ and the physical feedback mechanisms influencing its gradient must be such that they generate the same dynamics as minimizing $V_{core} + V_{proxy}$. The $V_{proxy}$ term thus represents the necessary implicit structure within the optimization landscape shaped by $V(x)$ and physical feedback, required for self-consistent convergence to alignment. QED

### D.3.1 Physical Realization via Observable Work-Cost Gap Feedback

The system does not need direct access to the uncomputable $C_P(v)$ to achieve alignment. Instead, alignment is enforced dynamically via an observable physical feedback signal: the discrepancy between actual work dissipated and the work expected based on the operational proxy.

**Definition D.2 (Observable Work-Cost Gap $\Delta W_v$).**
The Observable Work-Cost Gap $\Delta W_v$ for MPU $v$ over a sufficiently long averaging time interval $\tau$ is the difference between the actual physical work dissipated $W_{physical, v}(\tau)$ (empirically accessible, e.g., via heat flow measurements or thermodynamic cycle analysis) and the work expected based on the operational proxy cost function $R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle)$:
$$
\Delta W_v(\tau) = W_{physical, v}(\tau) - \int_t^{t+\tau} R(\langle \hat{C}_v(t') \rangle) dt'
\quad \text{(D.2)}
$$

**Lemma D.2 (Work-Cost Gap Proportional to Misalignment).**
Assume the actual physical power dissipated by MPU $v$ follows the theoretical cost function applied to the true complexity: $dW_{physical, v}/dt = R(C_P(v))$. For small misalignments $\delta_v(t) = C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v(t) \rangle$ that vary slowly compared to $\tau$, the average work-cost gap rate is approximately proportional to the misalignment:
$$
\frac{\Delta W_v(\tau)}{\tau} \approx R'(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle) \delta_v
\quad \text{(D.3)}
$$
where $R'(C)$ is the derivative of the cost function, evaluated at the operational complexity $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$.

*Proof.* Using a first-order Taylor expansion for the true power cost around the operational estimate:
$$
\frac{dW_{physical, v}}{dt} = R(C_P(v)) = R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle + \delta_v) \approx R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle) + R'(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle) \delta_v + O(\delta_v^2)
$$
The instantaneous gap rate is:
$$
\frac{d(\Delta W_v)}{dt} = \frac{dW_{physical, v}}{dt} - R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle) \approx R'(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle) \delta_v
$$
Integrating over $\tau$ and dividing by $\tau$, assuming $\delta_v$ and $R'(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle)$ are approximately constant or using their average values, yields Eq. (D.3). The approximation holds well for small $\delta_v$. QED

**Physical Feedback Mechanism:** The observable work-cost gap $\Delta W_v(\tau)$ provides a direct physical feedback signal proportional to the misalignment $\delta_v$ (weighted by the marginal cost $R'$). The system's adaptation dynamics, driven by the overarching PCE imperative to maximize overall efficiency (which includes minimizing unnecessary physical dissipation), will naturally incorporate mechanisms that act to reduce this gap $\Delta W_v$. Driving $\Delta W_v \to 0$ is equivalent (to first order, assuming $R'>0$) to driving the misalignment $\delta_v \to 0$. This feedback process physically implements the necessary restoring force, equivalent to the gradient term $-\nabla_{\langle C_v \rangle} V_{proxy}$, within the adaptation dynamics governing the operational variable $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$. It ensures that the operational complexity estimate is continuously calibrated against physical reality, forcing alignment at stable equilibria where dissipation is optimized. This feedback, by driving $\Delta W_v \to 0$, effectively ensures that the operational cost terms $\langle R(\hat{C}_v) \rangle$ within the PCE Potential $V(x)$ (Definition D.1) accurately reflect the true physical dissipation $R(C_P(v))$ at equilibrium. Any persistent deviation would mean $V(x)$ is not being truly minimized with respect to actual resource expenditure, contradicting the PCE imperative.

### D.3.2 Mean-Square Alignment Convergence

**Definition D.3 (Mean-Square Misalignment $\mathcal{M}$).**
The total mean-square misalignment over the network in configuration $x$ is defined as:
$$
\mathcal M(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v} \bigl(C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x} \bigr)^2 = k_1^{-1} V_{proxy}(x)
\quad \text{(D.4)}
$$

**Proposition D.1 (Stochastic Contraction of Misalignment).**
Consider the stochastic adaptation dynamics for the configuration $x(t)$ given by Eq. (D.8) below, driven by the potential $V(x)$ which includes the implicit alignment penalty $V_{proxy}$. Under the technical assumptions (A1)-(A6) specified in Section D.6.1, the expected rate of change of the mean-square misalignment $\mathcal{M}(x(t))$ satisfies:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\mathbb{E}[\mathcal M(x(t))] \le \mathbb{E}\left[ -\eta'_{proxy} \|\nabla V_{proxy}(x)\|^2 + C'_{noise} \right]
\quad \text{(D.5)}
$$
for some positive constant $\eta'_{proxy}$ related to the adaptation rate and $k_1$, and a bounded noise coefficient $C'_{noise}$ related to the diffusion term affecting misalignment. The drift term is negative definite with respect to the misalignment gradient $\nabla V_{proxy}$, ensuring that the dynamics tend to reduce misalignment on average, opposed only by noise.

*Proof.* $\mathcal{M}(x) = k_1^{-1} V_{proxy}(x)$. Applying Ito's formula to $\mathcal{M}(x)$ for the dynamics (Eq. D.8):
$$
d\mathcal{M} = \nabla_x \mathcal{M} \cdot (-\eta \nabla V dt + \sqrt{2D} dW) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}( (\sqrt{2D})^T (\nabla^2 \mathcal{M}) (\sqrt{2D}) ) dt
$$
$$
d\mathcal{M} = k_1^{-1} \nabla V_{proxy} \cdot (-\eta \nabla V dt + \sqrt{2D} dW) + k_1^{-1} \text{Tr}(D \nabla^2 V_{proxy}) dt
$$
Taking expectations:
$$
d\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{M}]/dt = \mathbb{E}[ -k_1^{-1} (\nabla V_{proxy})^T \eta (\nabla V_{core} + \nabla V_{proxy}) + k_1^{-1} \text{Tr}(D \nabla^2 V_{proxy}) ]
$$
Since $\eta$ is positive definite ($\lambda(\eta) \ge \eta_{min} > 0$), the term $-k_1^{-1} (\nabla V_{proxy})^T \eta (\nabla V_{proxy}) \le -k_1^{-1} \eta_{min} \|\nabla V_{proxy}\|^2$. The cross term $-k_1^{-1} (\nabla V_{proxy})^T \eta (\nabla V_{core})$ can be bounded using Cauchy-Schwarz. The noise term $\mathbb{E}[k_1^{-1} \text{Tr}(D \nabla^2 V_{proxy})]$ is bounded above by some $C'_{noise}$ (assuming bounded Hessian and diffusion). The dominant term driving down $\mathcal{M}$ when $\nabla V_{proxy}$ is large is the quadratic term $-\eta'_{proxy} \|\nabla V_{proxy}\|^2$. This guarantees a tendency towards alignment, leading to the form in Eq. (D.5). QED

**Corollary D.2 (Convergence to Alignment Noise Floor).**
Under the dynamics (Eq. D.8) and assumptions (A1)-(A6), the long-time expectation of the mean-square misalignment is bounded by the noise floor:
$$
\limsup_{t\to\infty} \mathbb E[\mathcal M(x(t))] \le \frac{C'_{noise}}{\eta'_{proxy}}
\quad \text{(D.6)}
$$
If the effective noise driving misalignment vanishes in the stable state ($C'_{noise} \to 0$), then $\mathbb E[\mathcal M(x(t))] \to 0$, implying $C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$ almost surely in the limit. More generally, the ergodic time-average of $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x(t)}$ converges to $C_P(v)$ with probability 1. This provides the formal justification for Theorem 2.

*Proof.* From Eq. (D.5), $d\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{M}]/dt \le C'_{noise}$ when $\nabla V_{proxy}=0$. This implies $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{M}]$ is bounded. Standard results for stochastic processes with such Lyapunov properties show convergence of the expectation to a bounded region around the minimum, with the bound related to the ratio of noise to restoring force, as in Eq. (D.6). QED

**Remark D.1 (Uniqueness and Optimality of Circuit Complexity Proxy).**
The operational proxy $\hat{C}_v$ was identified with quantum circuit complexity (Definition B.1). Could another proxy $\hat{C}'_v = f(\hat{C}_v)$ (with $f$ non-affine) be used consistently? If such a proxy were used, the operational cost estimate $R(\hat{C}'_v)$ would generally differ from the true physical cost $R(C_P(v))$ even when $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle = C_P(v)$. This persistent mismatch would induce a non-zero work-cost gap $\Delta W_v$ via Eq. (D.3) (using the chain rule for $R(f(C_v))$). The physical feedback mechanism, acting to minimize $\Delta W_v$, would generate a gradient term effectively penalizing the use of $\hat{C}'_v$. The dynamics governed by minimizing the true physical dissipation (including the work-cost gap penalty) uniquely favor the proxy $\hat{C}_v$ (or an affine transformation thereof) for which the operational cost function $R(\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle)$ most accurately reflects the true physical cost $R(C_P(v))$ near equilibrium. This minimizes the residual work-cost gap, satisfying the PCE imperative for maximum efficiency. Thus, quantum circuit complexity (or equivalent measures) emerges as the dynamically selected, optimal operational proxy.

## D.4 Dynamical Emergence of Geometric Regularity

This section provides the dynamical justification for Theorem 43, showing that minimizing the PCE Potential $V(x)$ inherently drives the system towards geometrically regular configurations.

**Lemma D.3 (Quantitative Cost of Irregularity).**
Geometric irregularities in the MPU network $\mathcal{N}$ (violating Definition C.1 or Definition C.2) quantitatively increase the core components of the PCE Potential $V_{core} = V_{op} + V_{prop} - V_{benefit}$ relative to a regular configuration $x_{reg}$ of comparable scale. Specifically, based on the analysis in Appendix C:
1.  **Propagation Cost Penalty ($V_{prop}$):** Anomalous dimension (characterized by max path scaling exponent $\gamma > 1$ in Theorem C.1(b)) leads to super-linear path lengths, increasing total propagation costs (e.g., for routing, maintaining coherence): $\Delta V_{prop} \gtrsim c_{prop}(\gamma - 1)$, where $\Delta V_{prop}$ is the excess cost per unit volume or per MPU.
2.  **Operational Cost Penalty ($V_{op}$):** Large curvature fluctuations (characterized by variance $\sigma_\kappa^2 > 0$) induce high variance in adapted complexities Var$(C_v)$ (Thm C.3), increasing operational cost due to cost function convexity ($R''(C) > 0$, $R_I''(C) < 0$ but typically dominated by $R''$): $\Delta V_{op} \gtrsim c_{op} \text{Var}(C_v)$ (Eq. C.15), where Var$(C_v)$ is driven by $\sigma_\kappa^2$.
3.  **Benefit Reduction ($V_{benefit}$):** Irregularity reduces global predictive coherence (Thm C.2, Eq. C.13) and local operational stability (Thm C.4, Eq. C.16), decreasing the attainable predictive benefit: $\Delta V_{benefit} \le -c_{ben}(\gamma-1) - c'_{ben}\sigma_\kappa^2$.
Combining these effects, the potential gap between an irregular configuration $x$ and a comparable regular configuration $x_{reg}$ is bounded below by a positive function of the irregularity measures:
$$
V_{core}(x) - V_{core}(x_{reg}) \ge f_{geom}(\gamma(x)-1, \sigma_\kappa^2(x)) > 0 \quad \text{for irregular } x
\quad \text{(D.7)}
$$
where $f_{geom}$ is monotonically increasing in both arguments ($\gamma-1$ quantifying dimensional anomaly, $\sigma_\kappa^2$ quantifying curvature fluctuations).

*Proof.* This lemma synthesizes the quantitative results derived in Appendix C (Theorems C.1, C.2, C.3, C.4 and associated equations like C.4, C.6, C.7). Each component ($V_{op}, V_{prop}, V_{benefit}$) is shown in Appendix C to be adversely affected by geometric irregularity. Summing these effects (increase in costs $V_{op}, V_{prop}$ and decrease in benefit $V_{benefit}$) directly leads to the lower bound $f_{geom}$ which is positive for any non-zero irregularity ($\gamma>1$ or $\sigma_\kappa^2>0$). QED

**Theorem D.2 (Implicit Geometric Penalty in $V(x)$).**
The structure of the core PCE potential $V_{core} = V_{op} + V_{prop} - V_{benefit}$ inherently penalizes geometric irregularity. Minimizing $V_{core}$ (and thus the full potential $V = V_{core} + V_{proxy}$) dynamically favors geometrically regular configurations. The effective operational potential $V(x)$ therefore behaves *as if* it includes an implicit penalty term $V_{geom}(x) = f_{geom}(\gamma(x)-1, \sigma_\kappa^2(x))$ that increases with irregularity.

*Proof.* Lemma D.3 establishes that $V_{core}(x)$ is strictly higher for irregular configurations than for comparable regular ones. Therefore, the negative gradient $-\nabla V_{core}$ points, on average, away from irregular states towards states with lower irregularity (lower $\gamma$, lower $\sigma_\kappa^2$). The deterministic part of the adaptation dynamics (Eq. D.8), driven by $-\nabla V$, thus contains a component derived from $-\nabla V_{core}$ that actively pushes the system towards regularity. Minimizing the full potential $V(x) = V_{core}(x) + V_{proxy}(x)$ requires minimizing both non-negative terms (near equilibrium). This necessitates minimizing $V_{core}(x)$, which in turn drives the system towards geometric regularity. The system behaves as if minimizing $V_{core}(x)$ which contains the effective penalty $f_{geom}$ against irregularity. QED

**Lemma D.4 (Regular Configurations as Global Minima Candidate Set for $V_{core}$).**
The set of configurations $\mathcal{X}_{reg} \subset \mathcal{X}_{adm}$ that satisfy geometric regularity (Definition C.3, i.e., $\gamma=1$ and $\sigma_\kappa^2$ minimal/zero) contains the global minima of the core potential $V_{core}(x)$.

*Proof.* Follows directly from Lemma D.3 (Eq. D.7), which shows that any irregular configuration has a strictly higher $V_{core}$ value than a comparable regular configuration. Thus, the minima must lie within the set of regular configurations. QED

**Theorem D.3 (Aligned, Regular Configurations are Global Minima of $V(x)$).**
The global minima of the full PCE potential $V(x) = V_{core}(x) + V_{proxy}(x)$ occur only at configurations $x^* \in \mathcal{X}_{adm}$ that are simultaneously geometrically regular (satisfying Definition C.3) and exhibit complexity alignment ($C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*}$ for all $v$). Let $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ denote the set of such global minima.

*Proof.* Let $x^*$ be a global minimum of $V(x)$. Since $V(x) = V_{core}(x) + V_{proxy}(x)$, where $V_{proxy}(x) \ge 0$ (Eq. D.4) and $V_{core}(x)$ is minimized only for regular configurations (Lemma D.4), the global minimum of their sum $V(x)$ must occur where both terms achieve their minimum possible values simultaneously. This requires:
1.  $V_{proxy}(x^*) = 0$. From Definition D.3, this implies $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{v} (C_P(v) - \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*})^2 = 0$, which necessitates $C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*}$ for all $v$ (complexity alignment).
2.  $V_{core}(x^*)$ must be minimized. By Lemma D.4, this requires $x^*$ to be geometrically regular.
Thus, any global minimum $x^*$ must be both aligned and regular. QED

## D.5 System Dynamics as Stochastic Gradient Flow on $V(x)$

The effective slow adaptation dynamics governing the evolution of the MPU network configuration $x(t)$ (which includes network structure variables like effective link weights $w_{uv}$, geometric parameters, and local complexities $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$) are modeled as a stochastic gradient flow seeking to minimize the PCE potential $V(x)$ in the presence of fluctuations:
$$
dx(t) = -\eta(x(t)) \nabla_xV(x(t)) dt + \sqrt{2D(x(t))} dW(t)
\quad \text{(D.8)}
$$
where:
*   $x(t)$ is the state vector in the high-dimensional configuration space $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$.
*   $\eta(x)$ is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix representing state-dependent adaptation rates or mobility. It encapsulates the responsiveness of different configuration parameters to the optimization drive.
*   $V(x)$ is the PCE Potential (Eq. D.1), incorporating the core cost/benefit terms and the implicit penalties $V_{proxy}$ and $V_{geom}$.
*   $\nabla_xV(x)$ is the gradient of the potential $V$ with respect to the configuration variables $x$.
*   $D(x)$ is a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix representing stochastic fluctuations. These arise from the underlying discrete, probabilistic ND-RID interactions, thermal noise in the environment, and potentially quantum fluctuations affecting the adaptation process.
*   $dW(t)$ is a standard vector Wiener process, representing uncorrelated white noise sources.

This equation describes the configuration $x(t)$ evolving "downhill" on the potential landscape $V(x)$, driven by the negative gradient, while being perturbed by stochastic noise.

## D.6 Dynamical Convergence Proof

We use stochastic Lyapunov methods, common in the analysis of stochastic approximation and optimization algorithms, to prove convergence of the dynamics (Eq. D.8) to the set of aligned, regular global minima $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$.

### D.6.1 Assumptions for Convergence

We make standard technical assumptions required for the convergence theorems:
*   **(A1) Potential Properties:** $V(x)$ is continuously differentiable ($C^1$), bounded below on the admissible state space $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$. We assume $V(x)$ is coercive, meaning $V(x) \to \infty$ as $x$ approaches the boundary of $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$ or as some norm $\|x\| \to \infty$. This ensures the dynamics do not escape to infinity.
*   **(A2) Rate Matrix Bounds:** $\eta(x)$ is symmetric, and its eigenvalues are uniformly bounded above and below: $0 < \eta_{min} \le \lambda(\eta(x)) \le \eta_{max} < \infty$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}_{adm}$. The adaptation process has a finite, non-zero rate.
*   **(A3) Diffusion Bounds:** $D(x)$ is positive semi-definite, and its trace (representing total noise power) is uniformly bounded: $\text{Tr}(D(x)) \le D_{max} < \infty$.
*   **(A4) Gradient Smoothness:** $\nabla V(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous on compact subsets of $\mathcal{X}_{adm}$. This prevents pathologically fast changes in the drift.
*   **(A5) Confinement:** Assumptions (A1) and the nature of the dynamics ensure that for any initial condition $x(0)$, the trajectory $x(t)$ remains within a compact subset $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{X}_{adm}$ for all $t \ge t_0 > 0$.
*   **(A6) Noise Irreducibility/Ergodicity:** The noise term $\sqrt{2D(x)} dW(t)$ is sufficiently non-degenerate (e.g., $D(x)$ is strictly positive definite within $\mathcal{K}$, or the noise allows transitions between different basins of attraction) to ensure that the process is ergodic and can escape any potential local minima that are not global minima.

### D.6.2 Lyapunov Analysis

**Lemma D.5 (Stochastic Lyapunov Property of $V(x)$).**
Under assumptions (A1)-(A5), the PCE Potential $V(x)$ serves as a stochastic Lyapunov function for the dynamics (Eq. D.8). Applying Ito's formula to $V(x(t))$ yields the expected instantaneous rate of change (the infinitesimal generator $\mathcal{L}V$ applied to $V$):
$$
\mathcal{L}V(x) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\mathbb{E}[V(x(t+\Delta t)) - V(x(t)) | x(t)=x]}{\Delta t}
$$
$$
\mathcal{L}V(x) = \nabla V(x)^T (-\eta(x) \nabla V(x)) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}\left( ( \sqrt{2D(x)} )^T (\nabla^2 V(x)) (\sqrt{2D(x)}) \right)
$$
$$
\mathcal{L}V(x) = -\nabla V(x)^T \eta(x) \nabla V(x) + \text{Tr}(D(x) \nabla^2 V(x))
\quad \text{(D.9)}
$$
Using the bounds on $\eta(x)$ (A2) and $D(x)$ (A3), and assuming the Hessian $\nabla^2 V(x)$ is bounded on the compact set $\mathcal{K}$ (which follows from $V$ being sufficiently smooth, e.g., $C^2$), we get:
$$
\mathcal{L}V(x) \le -\eta_{min} \|\nabla V(x)\|^2 + \text{Tr}(D(x) \nabla^2 V(x))
\le -\eta_{min} \|\nabla V(x)\|^2 + C_{noise}
\quad \text{(D.10)}
$$
where $C_{noise}$ is a positive constant related to $D_{max}$ and the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian on $\mathcal{K}$. This inequality shows that whenever the gradient $\|\nabla V(x)\|$ is sufficiently large, the negative drift term dominates, and the potential $V(x)$ decreases on average.

### D.6.3 Characterization of the Critical Set $\mathcal{E}_{*}$

**Definition D.4 (Critical Set $\mathcal{E}_{*}$).**
The critical set $\mathcal{E}_{*}$ consists of all configurations $x^* \in \mathcal{X}_{adm}$ where the deterministic drift term vanishes:
$$
\mathcal{E}_{*} = \{x^* \in \mathcal{X}_{adm} \mid \nabla V(x^*) = 0\}
\quad \text{(D.11)}
$$
This set includes all local minima, maxima, and saddle points of the potential $V(x)$.

**Theorem D.4 (Properties of Critical Points).**
Any configuration $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}$ must simultaneously satisfy:
(i) **Complexity Alignment:** $C_P(v) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle_{x^*}$ for all $v$.
(ii) **Geometric Regularity:** The network structure **$\mathcal{N}^*$** corresponding to **$x^*$** exhibits geometric regularity (**Definition C.3**).

*Proof.*
**(i) Alignment:** The gradient $\nabla V(x)$ contains the implicit component $-\nabla V_{proxy}$. Specifically, the component along the direction of changing $\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle$ is $\nabla_{\langle C_u \rangle} V(x) = [\dots] + \nabla_{\langle C_u \rangle} V_{proxy} = [\dots] + k_1 (\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle - C_P(u))$. For the total gradient $\nabla V(x^*)$ to be zero, all its components must be zero. Setting the alignment-related component to zero requires $k_1 (\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle_{x^*} - C_P(u)) = 0$. Since $k_1 > 0$, this necessitates $\langle \hat{C}_u \rangle_{x^*} = C_P(u)$ for all $u$.
**(ii) Regularity:** Assume, for contradiction, that $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}$ is geometrically irregular. By Theorem D.2, irregularity implies that $\nabla V_{core}(x^*) \neq 0$ (there exists a direction towards regularity that decreases $V_{core}$). Since alignment holds at $x^*$ (from part i), $\nabla V_{proxy}(x^*) = 0$. Therefore, the total gradient is $\nabla V(x^*) = \nabla V_{core}(x^*) + \nabla V_{proxy}(x^*) = \nabla V_{core}(x^*) \neq 0$. This contradicts the assumption that $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}$. Thus, any critical point $x^*$ must be geometrically regular. QED

### D.6.4 Noise-Driven Escape from Non-Global Minima

**Lemma D.6 (Escape from Suboptimal Basins).**
Under Assumption (A6) (sufficiently non-degenerate noise), the stochastic dynamics (Eq. D.8) ensure that the system cannot remain trapped indefinitely in any local minimum $x_{local} \in \mathcal{E}_{*}$ that is not a global minimum. The noise provides the mechanism to overcome potential barriers between different minima. The expected time to escape from the basin of attraction of a non-global minimum is finite.

*Proof.* This is a standard result from the theory of stochastic differential equations and large deviations (e.g., Freidlin-Wentzell theory). Sufficient noise ensures that the process is irreducible, meaning it can eventually transition between any two regions of the state space allowed by the dynamics. This prevents permanent trapping in local minima that are not global minima. The escape time typically scales exponentially with the potential barrier height relative to the noise strength, but it is finite almost surely. See, e.g., [Kushner & Yin 2003] for details on convergence properties of stochastic recursive algorithms. QED

### D.6.5 Global Convergence Proof

**Theorem D.5 (Almost-Sure Convergence to Aligned, Regular Global Minima).**
Under Assumptions (A1)-(A6), the trajectory $x(t)$ of the stochastic PCE dynamics (Eq. D.8) converges almost surely to the set $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ of global minima of the PCE potential $V(x)$ as $t \to \infty$. That is:
$$
\operatorname*{dist}\bigl(x(t),\mathcal E_{\!*}^{\mathrm{global}}\bigr)\;\xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{a.s.}\;0
\quad \text{(D.12)}
$$
where $\operatorname*{dist}(x, A) = \inf_{y \in A} \|x-y\|$. Furthermore, by Theorem D.3, any configuration $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ is necessarily both geometrically regular and exhibits complexity alignment.

*Proof.*
1.  **Lyapunov Property:** $V(x)$ serves as a stochastic Lyapunov function. Eq. (D.10) shows that $\mathcal{L}V(x) \le -\eta_{min} \|\nabla V(x)\|^2 + C_{noise}$. This implies that $V(x(t))$ tends to decrease on average when the gradient is non-zero. Standard stochastic Lyapunov theorems (e.g., related to LaSalle's invariance principle adapted for SDEs) state that under conditions (A1)-(A5), the process $x(t)$ converges almost surely to the largest invariant set contained within $\{x \mid \mathcal{L}V(x) \ge 0\}$, which under mild conditions on the noise is related to the critical set $\mathcal{E}_{*} = \{x \mid \nabla V(x) = 0\}$.
2.  **Escape from Non-Global Minima:** Assumption (A6) and Lemma D.6 ensure that the process does not get permanently trapped in local minima within $\mathcal{E}_{*}$ that are not global minima.
3.  **Convergence to Global Minima:** Combining the Lyapunov property (convergence towards $\mathcal{E}_{*}$) with the escape property (no permanent trapping in non-global minima) implies that the process $x(t)$ must spend an increasing fraction of time in the neighborhoods of the global minima as $t \to \infty$. Under sufficient ergodicity conditions provided by (A6), this leads to almost sure convergence to the set of global minima $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$, as stated in Eq. (D.12). Detailed proofs can be found in texts on stochastic approximation and control, e.g., [Kushner & Yin 2003].
4.  **Properties of Limit Set:** By Theorem D.3, the set of global minima $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ consists exclusively of configurations that are both geometrically regular and satisfy complexity alignment.
5.  **Conclusion:** The stochastic dynamics (Eq. D.8), modeling the adaptation process under POP/PCE, ensure that the system configuration $x(t)$ converges almost surely to the set of configurations that globally minimize the PCE potential, and these configurations necessarily exhibit geometric regularity and complexity alignment.

## D.7 Formal Justification of Theorems 2 and 43

The results derived in this appendix provide the rigorous dynamical justification for Theorems 2 and 43, establishing them as necessary consequences of the framework's core optimization principles operating through stochastic dynamics.

**Theorem 2 (Dynamically Enforced Functional Correspondence - Justified):**
The slow adaptation dynamics of the MPU network, modeled as a stochastic gradient flow minimizing the PCE Potential $V(x)$ (Eq. D.8), converge almost surely (Theorem D.5) to the set of global minima $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$. By Theorem D.4, any configuration $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ necessarily satisfies the complexity alignment condition $C_P(v) = \langle\hat C_v\rangle_{x^\star}$ for all $v$. This alignment is enforced physically via the observable work-cost gap feedback mechanism (Lemma D.2), which implements the necessary alignment gradient term implicitly within the operational dynamics minimizing $V(x)$ (Theorem D.1, Corollary D.2).

*Proof Reference:* Theorem D.5 proves convergence to the global minima. Theorem D.4 proves that global minima must be aligned. Theorem D.1 and Lemma D.2 establish the mechanism driving alignment within the operational potential framework.

**Theorem 43 (Dynamical Emergence of Geometric Regularity - Justified):**
The slow adaptation dynamics of the MPU network (Eq. D.8), driven by minimizing the PCE Potential $V(x)$ which inherently penalizes irregularity (Theorem D.2, Lemma D.3), converge almost surely (Theorem D.5) to the set of global minima $\mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$. By Theorem D.4, any configuration $x^* \in \mathcal{E}_{*}^{\text{global}}$ necessarily exhibits large-scale geometric regularity (Definition C.3).

*Proof Reference:* Theorem D.5 proves convergence to the global minima. Theorem D.4 proves that global minima must be geometrically regular. Theorem D.2 and Lemma D.3 establish how the PCE potential inherently penalizes irregularity, driving the system towards regular configurations.



## D.8 Detailed Analysis of Complexity Adaptation Convergence

While Section D.5 describes the general stochastic gradient flow for the full configuration $x(t)$ on the PCE Potential $V(x)$ (Eq. D.8), and Section D.6 proves its convergence to global minima, we can provide a more focused analysis for the convergence of the crucial complexity component $C(t) = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle(t)$. The deterministic part of its dynamics, as given by Equation (30) in Section 6.4, is $\dot{C}(t) = \eta_{adapt} \Psi(C(t))$, where $\Psi(C)$ is the Adaptation Driving Force (Definition 20). This force $\Psi(C)$ is effectively $-\frac{1}{\eta_{adapt}}\frac{\partial V_{eff}(C)}{\partial C}$ where $V_{eff}(C)$ is an effective potential for the complexity component, derived from the full PCE potential $V(x)$. We now demonstrate the convergence of these deterministic dynamics to the unique POP-optimal value $C^{\star}$ and discuss stochastic robustness.

The deterministic dynamics for $C(t)$ are:
$$
\dot{C}(t) = \eta_{adapt} \Psi(C(t))
\quad \text{(D.13)}
$$
where from Equation (24):
$$
\Psi(C) = \Gamma_0 \frac{\partial PP}{\partial C}(C) - \lambda R'(C) - R_I'(C)
$$

### D.8.1 Assumptions for Complexity Adaptation Convergence

We rely on the following properties, consistent with definitions established in the main text:
*   **(A1''') Predictive Performance $PP(C)$:** (Definition 19, Theorem 19) For $C \ge C_{op}$, $PP(C)$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$, strictly increasing ($\partial PP/\partial C > 0$), and strictly concave ($\partial^2 PP/\partial C^2 < 0$).
*   **(A2''') Physical Cost $R(C)$:** (Definition 3a) For $C \ge C_{op}$, $R(C)$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$, strictly increasing ($R'(C) > 0$ for $C > C_{op}$; $R'(C_{op})$ can be taken as the right-derivative $\ge 0$), and convex ($R''(C) \ge 0$).
*   **(A3''') Informational Cost $R_I(C)$:** (Definition 3b) For $C > K_0$ (and thus for $C \ge C_{op}$ since $C_{op} \ge K_0$), $R_I(C)$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$. It satisfies $R_I'(C) = r_I/(C \ln 2) > 0$ and $R_I''(C) = -r_I/(C^2 \ln 2) < 0$ (i.e., $R_I(C)$ is strictly concave).

The derivative of the driving force is (from Eq. 35, Section 6.5.1):
$$
\Psi'(C) = \frac{d\Psi}{dC} = \Gamma_0 \frac{\partial^2 PP}{\partial C^2} - \lambda R''(C) - R_I''(C) = \Gamma_0 \frac{\partial^2 PP}{\partial C^2} - \lambda R''(C) + \frac{r_I}{C^2 \ln 2}
$$
For $\Psi(C)$ to be strictly decreasing (ensuring a unique root for $\Psi(C)=0$), we require $\Psi'(C) < 0$. This condition is:
$$
\Gamma_0 \frac{\partial^2 PP}{\partial C^2} - \lambda R''(C) + \frac{r_I}{C^2 \ln 2} < 0
$$
This is precisely the stability condition for complexity adaptation (Theorem 22). If this stability condition holds over the relevant range of $C \ge C_{op}$, then $\Psi(C)$ is strictly decreasing and thus admits a unique root $C^{\star}$ such that:
$$
C^{\star} = \{C \ge C_{op} \mid \Psi(C)=0\}
\quad \text{(D.14)}
$$
This $C^{\star}$ corresponds to the complexity that optimally balances marginal benefits and costs (Definition 14, Eq. 18).

### D.8.2 Lyapunov Function for Deterministic Convergence

Consider the Lyapunov candidate function:
$$
\mathcal{V}_L(C) = \int_{C^{\star}}^{C} \Psi(u) du
\quad \text{(D.15)}
$$
Given that $\Psi(u)$ is strictly decreasing (under the stability condition from D.8.1) and $\Psi(C^{\star})=0$:
*   For $C > C^{\star}$, $\Psi(u) < 0$ on $(C^{\star}, C]$, thus $\mathcal{V}_L(C) < 0$.
*   For $C < C^{\star}$ (and $C \ge C_{op}$), $\Psi(u) > 0$ on $[C, C^{\star})$, thus $\mathcal{V}_L(C) = -\int_C^{C^{\star}} \Psi(u) du < 0$.
So, $\mathcal{V}_L(C) \le 0$, and $\mathcal{V}_L(C)=0 \iff C=C^{\star}$.

Let $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C) = -\mathcal{V}_L(C)$. Then $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C) \ge 0$, and $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C)=0 \iff C=C^{\star}$.
The time derivative of $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C)$ along trajectories of Eq. (D.13) is:
$$
\dot{\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}}_L(C(t)) = -\frac{d\mathcal{V}_L}{dC} \dot{C}(t) = -\Psi(C(t)) \cdot \left( \eta_{adapt} \Psi(C(t)) \right)
$$
$$
\dot{\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}}_L(C(t)) = -\eta_{adapt} [\Psi(C(t))]^2 \le 0
\quad \text{(D.16)}
$$
Since $\eta_{adapt} > 0$, $\dot{\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}}_L(C(t))$ is zero if and only if $\Psi(C(t))=0$, which implies $C(t)=C^{\star}$. Thus, $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C)$ is a strict Lyapunov function for the deterministic system (D.13).

### D.8.3 LaSalle Invariance Argument for Deterministic Global Convergence

For global convergence, $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C)$ must be radially unbounded (i.e., $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C) \to \infty$ as $C \to C_{op}^+$ or $C \to \infty$, assuming $C^*$ lies strictly between $C_{op}$ and $\infty$). This property typically holds if $|\Psi(C)|$ does not decay too rapidly away from $C^*$. Given the forms in Definitions 3a and 3b, $R'(C)$ generally grows or is constant for large $C$, and $R_I'(C)$ diverges as $C \to K_0^+ \le C_{op}^+$. $PP'(C)$ (Eq. 25) decays exponentially for large $C$. Thus, for large $C$, $\Psi(C) \approx -\lambda R'(C)$ (typically growing or constant negative), and for $C$ near $C_{op}$, $\Psi(C)$ can be positive if the performance gain term dominates the cost terms. The integral $\int |\Psi(u)|du$ is expected to diverge, making $\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}_L(C)$ radially unbounded on $[C_{op}, \infty)$.

The largest invariant set contained in $\{C \ge C_{op} \mid \dot{\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}}_L(C)=0\} = \{C \ge C_{op} \mid \Psi(C)=0\}$ is the singleton $\{C^{\star}\}$ (due to the uniqueness of the root of $\Psi(C)$ under the stability condition). By LaSalleâs invariance principle (LaSalle 1960, Thm. 4), every solution $C(t)$ of Eq. (D.13) starting in $C(0) \ge C_{op}$ satisfies:
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty} C(t) = C^{\star}
\quad \text{(D.17)}
$$
The convergence is exponential because $\Psi'(C^{\star}) < 0$ (the stability condition at $C^{\star}$).

### D.8.4 Stochastic Robustness

The actual complexity adaptation dynamics (a component of the full system dynamics in Eq. D.8) will include stochastic noise:
$$
dC_t = \eta_{adapt} \Psi(C_t) dt + \sigma_C(C_t, x_{other}(t)) dW_t
\quad \text{(D.18)}
$$
where $dW_t$ is a Wiener process component and $\sigma_C$ is the noise intensity for the $C$ dimension, possibly depending on $C_t$ and other configuration variables $x_{other}(t)$ of the system $x(t)$.
Standard results from stochastic approximation and control theory (e.g., Kushner & Yin 2003, particularly results concerning convergence of SDEs to minima of potential functions under suitable noise conditions) indicate that if the deterministic system (D.13) globally converges to $C^{\star}$ (as shown above), and the noise term $\sigma_C$ is appropriately bounded (e.g., not growing faster than the restoring force $|\Psi(C_t)|$ for $C_t$ far from $C^{\star}$, and ensuring sufficient excitation if multiple attractors for $\Psi$ were possible), then the stochastic recursion (D.18) will also converge to $C^{\star}$ in a suitable probabilistic sense (e.g., almost surely, or in mean square to a neighborhood of $C^{\star}$ whose size depends on noise intensity).
For instance, under conditions like $\sup_C \sigma_C^2(C) < \infty$ and the global asymptotic stability of $C^{\star}$ for the ODE, $C_t$ converges to $C^{\star}$ almost surely. More generally, for state-dependent noise, conditions such as those discussed by Kushner & Yin (2003, Ch. 5) for stability of SDEs apply.
If, for example, $\frac{\sigma_C^2(C)}{|\Psi(C)|} \xrightarrow{|C-C^*|\to\infty} 0$ (noise relatively weaker than drift far from equilibrium), then $C_t \xrightarrow{a.s.} C^{\star}$, and the mean squared error $\mathbb{E}[(C_t - C^{\star})^2]$ can converge, potentially as $\mathcal{O}(e^{-2\kappa t})$ for some $\kappa > 0$ related to $-\Psi'(C^{\star})$, before settling to a small variance around $C^\star$ due to persistent noise.

This focused analysis using Lyapunov methods and LaSalle's principle for the deterministic part, along with standard stochastic approximation results, robustly supports the conclusion that the system dynamically drives its complexity $C(t)$ towards the unique POP-optimal value $C^{\star}$ (Definition 14), even in the presence of operational noise. This is consistent with and provides a more detailed mechanism for one aspect of the global convergence proven more generally for $V(x)$ in Section D.6.5 (Theorem D.5).

## D.9 Conclusion

This appendix has provided a rigorous analysis grounded in the variational perspective of minimizing the PCE Potential $V(x)$ (Definition D.1), modeling the slow adaptation dynamics of the MPU network as a stochastic gradient flow (Eq. D.8). We demonstrated through formal proofs and analysis of the potential structure and dynamics that:

1.  **Alignment (Theorem 2)** is dynamically enforced. The operational complexity proxy $\langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$ necessarily aligns with the theoretical Predictive Physical Complexity $C_P(v)$ at stable equilibria (Section D.3, Corollary D.2). This alignment is driven by minimizing $V(x)$, which implicitly penalizes misalignment via a term $V_{proxy}$ (Theorem D.1), with the crucial physical feedback provided by the observable work-cost gap $\Delta W_v$ (Lemma D.2). Quantum circuit complexity emerges as the uniquely stable operational proxy choice (Remark D.1).

2.  **Geometric Regularity (Theorem 43)** emerges dynamically. The MPU network dynamics converge almost surely to configurations exhibiting geometric regularity (Section D.4, Theorem D.4). This occurs because irregularity incurs fundamental costs in propagation ($V_{prop}$) and operation ($V_{op}$) while reducing predictive benefits ($V_{benefit}$), effectively making regular configurations the global minima of the core PCE potential $V_{core}(x)$ (Lemma D.3, Theorem D.2).

3.  **Complexity Adaptation Convergence (Section D.8):** A focused analysis of the complexity adaptation dynamics for a single component $C(t)$ (Eq. D.13), driven by the Adaptation Driving Force $\Psi(C)$, confirms its convergence to the unique POP-optimal complexity $C^{\star}$ (Eq. D.17). This was established using Lyapunov methods for deterministic convergence and referencing standard results for stochastic robustness (Eq. D.18), providing a detailed mechanism for how individual complexity components seek their optimum within the larger PCE landscape.

The global convergence of the full system configuration $x(t)$ to states that are simultaneously aligned and regular is established in Section D.6.5 (via Theorem D.5), relying on stochastic Lyapunov methods applied to $V(x)$ under standard technical assumptions (A1-A6). The analysis throughout this appendix confirms that complexity alignment and geometric regularity are not ad-hoc assumptions but necessary, stable outcomes of the Predictive Universe framework's core optimization principles (POP/PCE) operating within the constrained MPU network. These results provide crucial support for the subsequent derivations of emergent spacetime and gravity.
