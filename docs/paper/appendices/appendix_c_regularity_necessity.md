# Appendix C: Necessity of Geometric Regularity

**C.1 Introduction: The Requirement for Geometric Order**

This Appendix provides the detailed technical analysis rigorously justifying Theorem 43 (Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity). It establishes that large-scale geometric irregularities in the underlying Minimal Predictive Unit (MPU) network structure are fundamentally incompatible with the operational requirements mandated by the Predictive Universe (PU) framework's core principles. Specifically, we demonstrate that networks lacking geometric regularity inevitably violate one or more of the following essential conditions for sustained, efficient operation:

*   **(R1) Local Viability:** Each MPU $v$ must maintain its Predictive Performance $PP(v)$ within the Space of Becoming $(\alpha, \beta)$ (Axiom 3). This requires stable local adaptation dynamics.
*   **(R2) Global Coherence:** The network must support the propagation and maintenance of coherent predictive information over macroscopic scales to effectively solve the aggregate Prediction Optimization Problem (POP, Axiom 1).
*   **(R3) Resource Efficiency:** The network configuration must represent an efficient allocation of resources (complexity, energy, time) according to the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE, Definition 15), avoiding prohibitive costs.

The argument proceeds by first defining geometric regularity (Section C.2), then providing a constructive microscopic basis for a positive Ricci curvature bound from PU principles (Section C.3), which is a key component of regularity. Subsequently, we demonstrate how violations of regularity—specifically anomalous dimension (Section C.4) and large curvature fluctuations (Section C.5)—lead to quantifiable functional failures or unsustainable resource costs. This culminates in proving that geometric regularity is a necessary condition for any stable, viable MPU network configuration (Section C.6). This result is crucial for justifying the emergence of a smooth, regular spacetime manifold (Section 11) from the underlying discrete MPU network.

**C.2 Formal Definitions of Geometric Properties**

We precisely define the geometric properties of the MPU network $\mathcal{N}=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \{w_{uv}\})$ relevant to our analysis, using the ND-RID propagation cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$ (Definition 35), which measures the minimum cost path length between vertices $u, v \in \mathcal{V}$.

**Definition C.1 (Uniform D-dimensional Polynomial Volume Growth).** A sequence of MPU networks $\{\mathcal{N}_n\}$ (indexed by size $n \to \infty$) exhibits uniform D-dimensional polynomial volume growth if there exist positive constants $K_1, K_2$, a dimension $D \ge 1$, and a macroscopic scale $R_0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$, for all vertices $v \in \mathcal{V}_n$, and all radii $R > R_0$:
$$
K_1 \left(\frac{R}{\delta_{eff, n}}\right)^D \leq |B_{R}(v)| \leq K_2 \left(\frac{R}{\delta_{eff, n}}\right)^D
\quad \text{(C.1)}
$$
where $B_{R}(v) = \{u \in \mathcal{V}_n \mid d_{\mathcal{N}_n}(v, u) \leq R\}$ is the metric ball defined by the cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}_n}$, $|B_{R}(v)|$ denotes the number of vertices in the ball, and $\delta_{eff, n}$ is the characteristic microscopic cost distance scale (e.g., $\ell_0 \langle w_{uv} \rangle_{avg}$) for network $\mathcal{N}_n$. Networks failing to satisfy this condition for a single integer $D$ over relevant scales exhibit anomalous dimension.

**Definition C.2 (Uniformly Bounded Synthetic Ricci Curvature).** An MPU network $\mathcal{N}$ has uniformly bounded synthetic Ricci curvature if there exists a constant $K \in \mathbb{R}$ such that a suitable measure of discrete Ricci curvature (e.g., Ollivier-Ricci curvature $\kappa_{\mathcal{N}}(x,y)$ for edges [Ollivier 2009], or related spectral measures [Lin & Yau 2010]) satisfies $\kappa_{\mathcal{N}}(x,y) \ge -K$ uniformly across the network. As argued in Section C.3, PU principles favor a positive lower bound. Networks where the lower bound $K$ effectively diverges (i.e., curvature is not bounded below) or where the spatial variance of the curvature Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ is large over macroscopic regions exhibit large or unbounded curvature fluctuations.

**Definition C.3 (Geometric Regularity).** An MPU network $\mathcal{N}$ exhibits geometric regularity if it satisfies both Definition C.1 (Uniform D-dim Polynomial Volume Growth for some integer D) and Definition C.2 (Uniformly Bounded Synthetic Ricci Curvature with a positive lower bound $\kappa_R > 0$ and bounded variance). Geometric irregularity refers to the violation of either or both of these conditions.

**C.3 Microscopic Basis for a Positive Ricci Curvature Bound from PU Principles**

This section provides a constructive argument demonstrating how local MPU interaction rules, consistent with the Predictive Universe (PU) principles, can lead to an emergent positive lower bound on a specific discrete measure of Ricci curvature—the Ollivier-Ricci curvature [Ollivier 2009]. This offers a microscopic basis for satisfying the "uniformly bounded synthetic Ricci curvature" condition (Definition C.2, main text Definition 37), which is an essential component of geometric regularity (**Definition C.3**).

This derivation models the one-step transition probabilities $\mathcal{P}\delta_v(u) = P_{vu}$ from an MPU $v$ to a neighboring MPU $u$ (where $d(v,u)=1$ in the underlying MPU graph, using the cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$ from main text Definition 35). These probabilities are assumed to be influenced by the local Predictive Physical Complexity $C_P(x)$ at different MPUs, reflecting how predictive load or information processing requirements affect network flow and resource allocation as governed by PCE.

Let the transition probability from $v$ to a neighbor $u$ be given by a model of the form:
$$
P_{vu} = \frac{P^{(0)}_{vu} \exp(-\lambda_{R} I'(C_P(u)))}{Z_v}
\quad \text{(C.2)}
$$
where $P^{(0)}_{vu}$ is a baseline, symmetric transition probability (e.g., $1/\text{deg}(v)$ if unbiased, reflecting the underlying network topology before complexity-dependent weighting), $I'(C_P(u))$ is the derivative of an effective local cost-rate function $I(c)$ (evaluated at the complexity $c=C_P(u)$ of the target MPU $u$), $\lambda_{R} > 0$ is a sensitivity parameter determining how strongly $I'$ influences transitions,¹ and $Z_v = \sum_{w \sim v} P^{(0)}_{vw} \exp(-\lambda_{R} I'(C_P(w)))$ is the local normalization factor ensuring $\sum_{u \sim v} P_{vu} = 1$. The function $I(c)$ represents the PCE-optimal effective cost associated with operating at complexity $c$.

The Ollivier-Ricci curvature for an edge directed from $v$ to $u$ is defined using the Wasserstein-1 distance $W_1$ between the probability distributions $\mathcal{P}\delta_v = \{P_{vx}\}_{x \sim v}$ and $\mathcal{P}\delta_u = \{P_{ux}\}_{x \sim u}$:
$$
\operatorname{Ric}_{\mathrm{OR}}(v \to u) = 1 - \frac{W_1(\mathcal{P}\delta_v, \mathcal{P}\delta_u)}{d(v,u)}
\quad \text{(C.3)}
$$
For adjacent nodes where $d(v,u)=1$ (representing a single effective link cost unit), this simplifies to $\operatorname{Ric}_{\mathrm{OR}}(v \to u) = 1 - W_1(\mathcal{P}\delta_v, \mathcal{P}\delta_u)$. We utilize the bound $W_1(\mathcal{P}\delta_v, \mathcal{P}\delta_u) \le \|P_{v\bullet} - P_{u\bullet}\|_1$, where $P_{x\bullet}$ denotes the probability vector originating from $x$.

**C.3.1 Properties of the Effective Cost-Rate Function $I(c)$**
The effective cost-rate function $I(c)$, reflecting the local contribution to the global PCE Potential $V(x)$ (main text Definition D.1) due to complexity $c=C_P$, is shaped by the interplay of predictive performance benefits and resource costs. Based on the properties of $PP(c)$ (concave, main text Definition 19), $R(c)$ (convex, main text Definition 3a), and $R_I(c)$ (concave, main text Definition 3b), it is assumed that for PCE-optimal configurations, $I(c)$ is both $m$-strongly convex (i.e., $I''(c) \ge m > 0$, ensuring it has a well-defined minimum and certain growth properties facilitating stable optimization) and $M$-smooth (i.e., $I''(c) \le M < \infty$; we denote this upper smoothness bound by $M$, used below) over the relevant range of complexities $c \in [C_{op}, C_{max_phys}]$ (where $C_{max_phys}$ is the maximum physically sustainable complexity). The $M$-smoothness implies its derivative $I'(c) = \partial_{C_P}I(c)$ is $M$-Lipschitz continuous:
$$
|I'(C_P(v))-I'(C_P(u))| \;\le\; M\,|C_P(v)-C_P(u)|.
\quad \text{(C.4)}
$$

**C.3.2 Bound on Spatial $C_P$ Variation Across Links**
The adaptation dynamics driven by PCE (e.g., Law of Prediction, main text Section 6, and the global minimization of $V(x)$ as per main text Appendix D) lead to a spatially correlated complexity distribution. For neighboring vertices $v, u$ (connected by a single ND-RID link, $d(v,u)=1$), the difference in instantaneous Predictive Physical Complexity $C_P$ is bounded:
$$
|C_P(v)-C_P(u)| \;\le\; L_{C_P},
\quad \text{(C.5)}
$$
where $L_{C_P} < \infty$ is an effective Lipschitz constant for the spatial variation of $C_P$ between adjacent MPUs. This bound arises because PCE disfavors excessively sharp spatial gradients in $C_P$, which would incur high propagation costs (part of $V_{prop}$ in main text Def D.1) or lead to inefficient resource allocation. The finite rate of complexity adaptation (main text Equation 30) and the local nature of MPU interactions contribute to this emergent spatial smoothness.

**C.3.3 Bounding Total Variation and Deriving the Ricci Lower Bound**
The difference between the probability distributions $P_{v\bullet}$ and $P_{u\bullet}$ is primarily driven by the difference in the exponential weighting terms $\exp(-\lambda_{R} I'(C_P(x)))$. Applying the Mean Value Inequality to these exponential factors:
$$
\Bigl|\exp(-\lambda_{R} I'(C_P(v)))-\exp(-\lambda_{R} I'(C_P(u)))\Bigr| \;\le\; \lambda_{R}\,e^{-\lambda_{R} I'_{\!*}}\, |I'(C_P(v))-I'(C_P(u))|,
\quad \text{(C.6)}
$$
where $I'_{\!*}$ is some value between $I'(C_P(v))$ and $I'(C_P(u))$.
Combining this with (C.4) and (C.5), and sketching the argument for the $L_1$ norm (a full derivation involves careful handling of $P^{(0)}$ and $Z_x$ effects): the $L_1$ distance $\|P_{v\bullet}-P_{u\bullet}\|_{1}$ can be bounded by a sum of terms, each proportional to differences like that in (C.6). The dominant contribution to this difference comes from vertices $x$ where $P^{(0)}_{vx}$ and $P^{(0)}_{ux}$ are non-zero. Assuming a locally symmetric baseline $P^{(0)}$ and that $Z_v \approx Z_u$ for slowly varying $I'$, the $L_1$ difference will be roughly proportional to the average difference in the exponential terms, weighted by $P^{(0)}$. This leads to a bound of the form:
$$
\|P_{v\bullet}-P_{u\bullet}\|_{1} \;\le\; C_{geom} \cdot \lambda_{R}\,e^{\lambda_{R} B}\,M\,L_{C_P},
\quad \text{(C.7)}
$$
where $B = \sup_w |I'(C_P(w))|$ is finite (since $C_P$ operates in a bounded range $[C_{op}, C_{max_phys}]$ for viable systems, and $I'$ is continuous on this compact set), and $C_{geom}$ is an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant reflecting local graph geometry (e.g., average degree). We define the parameter with the geometric factor kept explicit:

$$
\eta_{R} \;:=\; C_{geom}\,\lambda_{R}\,e^{\lambda_{R} B}\,M\,L_{C_P}.
\quad \text{(C.8)}
$$
For the MPU network to function as a stable, information-processing substrate, this parameter $\eta_{R}$ must be strictly less than 1. The parameter $\eta_R$ bounds the Wasserstein-1 distance, which in turn bounds the distinguishability of the local one-step evolution distributions originating from nodes $v$ and $u$. If $\eta_R \ge 1$, it would imply that a small, bounded difference in the underlying control parameter ($C_P$) could lead to a large, potentially maximal difference in the resulting probability distributions. This signifies a channel with extremely high sensitivity or "information gain" regarding the parameter $C_P$. Such high sensitivity is fundamentally incompatible with the established information-theoretic limits of the underlying ND-RID channels. These channels are strictly contractive ($f_{RID} < 1$, Lemma E.1) and have a finite classical capacity $C_{max} < \ln d_0$ (Theorem E.2). A value of $\eta_R \ge 1$ would correspond to an effective local channel for inferring $C_P$ whose capacity could exceed these fundamental bounds, a configuration that is physically unrealizable or thermodynamically prohibitive. Therefore, the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE), by forcing the system to operate within these established thermodynamic and information-theoretic constraints, must select for effective interaction parameters and network configurations such that $\eta_{R} < 1$.

Given $W_1(\mathcal P\delta_v,\mathcal P\delta_u) \le \|P_{v\bullet}-P_{u\bullet}\|_{1}$, we have:
$$
W_1\bigl(\mathcal P\delta_v,\mathcal P\delta_u\bigr)\;\le\;\eta_{R}.
\quad \text{(C.9)}
$$
Substituting this into the definition of Ollivier-Ricci curvature (Eq. C.3) with $d(v,u)=1$:
$$
\operatorname{Ric}_{\mathrm{OR}}(v \to u)\;\ge\;1-\eta_{R}.
$$
Defining $\kappa_{R} := 1-\eta_{R}$:

$$
\kappa_{R} = 1 - C_{geom}\,\lambda_{R}\,e^{\lambda_{R} B}\,M\,L_{C_P}.
\quad \text{(C.10)}
$$

Since PCE, through consistency with fundamental ND-RID information limits, enforces $\eta_{R} < 1$, it follows that $\kappa_{R} > 0$. Equivalently, adopting a lazy one‑step kernel with idleness $\alpha\in(0,1)$ reduces $W_1$ and can strictly increase $\kappa_R$ for fixed local parameters. This establishes a strictly positive lower bound on this measure of discrete Ricci curvature, arising from the interplay of PCE-optimized local complexity variations and the information-theoretic constraints of the underlying MPU interactions. A network with such a positive lower bound on Ricci curvature (meaning it is bounded below by $\kappa_R > 0$) satisfies a key component of geometric regularity (Definition C.2, Definition C.3), providing a constructive basis for the emergence of a well-behaved spacetime geometry. The subsequent sections of this appendix detail why violations of such regularity are penalized by PCE.


¹ Footnote: The parameter $\lambda_R$ is specific to this curvature model (Eq. C.2) and represents the sensitivity of local transition probabilities to gradients in the effective cost-rate $I'$. It should not be confused with the resource scarcity Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ from main text Definition 20.


**C.4 Penalization of Anomalous Network Dimension**

We first demonstrate that anomalous dimension (Definition C.1 violated) leads to violations of global coherence (R2) and resource efficiency (R3).

**Theorem C.1 (Path Length Scaling in Regular vs. Irregular Geometries).**
Let $\mathcal{N}=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ be an MPU network with cost distance $d_{\mathcal{N}}$. Let $L$ denote a characteristic macroscopic Euclidean distance scale within the network's embedding.
* (a) **Regular Geometry:** If $\mathcal{N}$ exhibits uniform D-dimensional polynomial volume growth (Def C.1), the average cost distance $\langle d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \rangle$ and the maximum cost distance $d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L)$ between points separated by Euclidean distance $L$ scale approximately linearly with $L$:
  $$ 
    \langle d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \rangle \approx c_{avg} L, \quad d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) \approx c_{max} L
    \quad \text{(C.11)}
    $$
where $c_{avg}, c_{max}$ depend on the average microscopic cost $\delta_{eff}$ and the discrete graph structure.
* (b) **Irregular Geometry (Anomalous Dimension):** If $\mathcal{N}$ exhibits anomalous dimension (e.g., fractal-like structure, significant bottlenecks), the average and/or maximum cost path distances typically scale super-linearly with the Euclidean scale $L$:
$$
\langle d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \rangle \propto L^{\beta}, \quad d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) \propto L^{\gamma} \quad (\text{with } \beta \ge 1, \gamma > 1)
    \quad \text{(C.12)}
$$
At least one exponent (typically $\gamma$ reflecting worst-case paths) must be strictly greater than 1.

*Proof:*
* **(a) Regular:** A network satisfying Def C.1 implies that the number of vertices grows like $R^D$, characteristic of a D-dimensional space. In such spaces, for points separated by Euclidean distance $L$, the shortest path length in terms of graph steps ($d_{graph}$) scales linearly with $L$ on average, $d_{graph} \approx L / \delta_{graph}$, where $\delta_{graph}$ is the typical distance per step. The cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$ (Definition 35) accumulates costs $w_{uv} \approx \delta_{eff}/\delta_{graph}$ along the path, where $\delta_{eff}$ is the average cost per step. Thus, the total cost distance is $d_{\mathcal{N}} \approx d_{graph} \times (\delta_{eff})$. Substituting the linear scaling of $d_{graph}$ yields $d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \approx (L / \delta_{graph}) \times \delta_{eff} = (\delta_{eff}/\delta_{graph}) L$. Since $\delta_{eff}/\delta_{graph}$ is a ratio of microscopic scales, $d_{\mathcal{N}}(L)$ scales linearly with $L$. Both average and maximum path lengths are expected to exhibit this linear scaling in well-behaved, regular D-dimensional structures.
* **(b) Irregular:** Networks with anomalous dimension lack the uniform scaling properties of regular lattices or manifolds. They often contain bottlenecks (regions of reduced connectivity forcing long detours) or exhibit fractal geometry where paths are inherently tortuous. Standard results in graph theory and percolation theory [Havlin & Ben-Avraham 1987] show that shortest path lengths (chemical distance $d_{graph}$) on such structures scale super-linearly with Euclidean distance $L$, i.e., $d_{graph} \propto L^{d_{min}}$ where $d_{min} > 1$ is the fractal path dimension. Since the cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$ accumulates costs along these paths, $d_{\mathcal{N}} \approx \delta_{eff} d_{graph}$, it inherits this super-linear scaling, particularly for the maximum path length: $d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) \propto L^\gamma$ with $\gamma = d_{min} > 1$. The average path length exponent $\beta$ may also be greater than 1, or remain $\approx 1$ if only sparse regions are highly irregular, but the maximum path length exponent $\gamma$ characteristically exceeds 1. QED

**Theorem C.2 (Quantitative Viability Failure due to Anomalous Dimension).** MPU networks $\mathcal{N}_{irreg}$ exhibiting anomalous dimension, leading to super-linear maximum path scaling $d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) \propto L^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma > 1$ (Theorem C.1(b)), necessarily violate core PU framework requirements (R2: Global Coherence, R3: Resource Efficiency) for sufficiently large system size $L$, rendering them non-viable.

* **(i) Violation of Global Coherence (R2):** Coherent propagation of predictive information (e.g., maintaining quantum phase coherence or high fidelity for classical signals) across a macroscopic scale $L$ requires transmission along network paths. The effective signal degradation depends on the path length in the cost metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$. Let the measure of coherence $MP_{Global}(L)$ after traversing a maximum cost distance $d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L)$ be bounded. Each ND-RID step in the path acts as a noisy channel, characterized by strict contractivity $f_{RID} < 1$ (Lemma E.1). The number of effective steps is $N_{steps} \approx d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) / \delta_{eff}$. Signal coherence, measured for instance by trace distance $D$ to an ideal state, decays exponentially with steps: $D(N_{steps}) \le D_0 \cdot (f_{RID})^{N_{steps}}$. Using the scaling from Theorem C.1(b), $d_{\mathcal{N}, max}(L) \approx c_{max}' L^\gamma$, we get:
    $$
    MP_{Global}(L) \approx D(N_{steps}) \le D_0 \cdot (f_{RID})^{\frac{c_{max}' L^\gamma}{\delta_{eff}}} = D_0 \exp\left(-\frac{c_{max}' |\ln f_{RID}|}{\delta_{eff}} L^\gamma\right)
    \quad \text{(C.13)}
    $$
    Since $\gamma > 1$ and $|\ln f_{RID}| > 0$ (because $f_{RID}<1$), the coherence decays faster than exponentially with $L$. For any minimum required level of global coherence $MP_{min} > 0$ necessary to solve the aggregate POP (Axiom 1), there exists a finite critical system size $L_{crit}^{(R2)}(\gamma)$ beyond which this requirement is violated ($MP_{Global}(L) < MP_{min}$). This critical size is given by solving $MP_{min} = D_0 \exp(- (\dots) (L_{crit}^{(R2)})^\gamma)$:
    $$
    L_{crit}^{(R2)}(\gamma) = \left( \frac{\delta_{eff} \ln(D_0 / MP_{min})}{c_{max}' |\ln f_{RID}|} \right)^{1/\gamma}
    \quad \text{(C.14)}
    $$
    The finiteness of $L_{crit}^{(R2)}$ for $\gamma > 1$ guarantees that anomalous dimension leads to a breakdown of global predictive coherence (violation of R2) in large enough systems. This decay in coherence translates to a reduction in the $V_{benefit}(x)$ term of the PCE Potential (Definition D.1), penalizing such configurations.
* **(ii) Violation of Resource Efficiency (R3):** The Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE, Definition 15) requires minimizing resource costs, represented in the PCE Potential $V(x)$ (Definition D.1) which includes a propagation cost term $V_{prop}$. $V_{prop}$ accounts for the resources needed to maintain communication infrastructure and transmit information across the network. In a network of size $N$ (number of MPUs), the total available resource budget $V_{max}$ is expected to scale extensively, $V_{max} \propto N$. For a D-dimensional regular network, $N \propto L^D$. If the network has anomalous dimension such that the *average* path distance scales super-linearly, $\langle d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \rangle \propto L^{\beta}$ with $\beta > 1$, the total integrated path length needed for global communication might scale as $N \times \langle d_{\mathcal{N}}(L) \rangle \propto L^D \cdot L^{\beta} = L^{D+\beta}$. Since $\beta > 1$, this total cost $V_{prop}$ scales super-extensively ($V_{prop} \propto L^{D+\beta}$ where $D+\beta > D$). Even if the average path length scales linearly ($\beta=1$), the super-linear scaling of maximum paths ($\gamma>1$) often implies higher average costs per link or higher costs for robust routing, leading to $V_{prop}$ growing faster than $L^D$. A super-extensive cost $V_{prop}$ will inevitably exceed an extensive budget $V_{max}$ for sufficiently large $L$; this represents an unsustainable increase in the $V_{prop}(x)$ component of the PCE Potential (Definition D.1). Thus, anomalous dimension leads to unsustainable propagation costs, violating resource efficiency (R3).

*Proof:*
* **(i)** The proof follows from the standard properties of signal decay under repeated application of a strictly contractive map ($f_{RID}<1$) over a path whose length $N_{steps}$ scales super-linearly with the system's Euclidean size $L$. The exponential decay combined with the super-linear exponent $L^\gamma$ guarantees that coherence falls below any fixed threshold $MP_{min}$ at a finite size $L_{crit}^{(R2)}$, derived explicitly in Equation (C.14).
* **(ii)** The proof compares the scaling of the necessary communication cost $V_{prop}$ with the scaling of the available resource budget $V_{max}$. Super-linear scaling of average or effective path lengths leads to $V_{prop}$ growing faster than $N \propto L^D$, while resources $V_{max}$ are expected to scale as $N$. The inequality $V_{prop} > V_{max}$ must eventually hold for large $L$ if $V_{prop}$ scales super-extensively, demonstrating a violation of resource efficiency demanded by PCE. QED

**C.5 Penalization of Unbounded Curvature Fluctuations**

We now demonstrate that large variations in local geometry, quantified by curvature fluctuations (violating Definition C.2 if no positive lower bound $\kappa_R > 0$ exists or if variance is large), lead to violations of local viability (R1) and resource efficiency (R3).

**Theorem C.3 (Predictive Load Volatility from Curvature Fluctuations).** Regions $R_{fluct} \subset \mathcal{V}$ within an MPU network exhibiting large spatial fluctuations in effective synthetic Ricci curvature (high Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ or regions where $\kappa_{\mathcal{N}}$ is not bounded below by $\kappa_R > 0$) necessarily induce high spatial volatility in the local effective environmental complexity scale $\hat{C}_{target}(v)$ (Definition 21) that each MPU $v \in R_{fluct}$ must track to maintain its target Predictive Performance $PP(v) \approx PP_{op}$ within the viable range $(\alpha, \beta)$.

*Proof:* Discrete Ricci curvature quantifies the local divergence or convergence of information propagation pathways relative to a flat reference geometry. Positive curvature (like $\kappa_R > 0$) implies pathways converge locally, potentially simplifying the task of integrating information from neighbors and predicting local dynamics (lower *actual* complexity $\hat{C}_{actual}$). Negative or highly fluctuating curvature implies pathways diverge unpredictably, potentially making local prediction harder due to rapid information dispersion or unstable focusing (higher or more volatile $\hat{C}_{actual}$). Therefore, large spatial variations in curvature Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ or the absence of a uniform positive lower bound directly correlate with large spatial variations or volatility in the local predictive environment's complexity, Var$(\hat{C}_{actual}(v))$. The MPU's internal estimate $\hat{C}_{target}(v)$ is dynamically adjusted (Equation 38) to track this actual local complexity $\hat{C}_{actual}(v)$ in order to maintain optimal performance $PP_{op}$. Consequently, high Var$(\hat{C}_{actual}(v))$ necessitates high Var$(\hat{C}_{target}(v))$ for MPUs operating in the fluctuating region. QED

**Theorem C.4 (Operational Cost and Stability Penalty for Curvature Fluctuations).** MPU networks $\mathcal{N}_{unbounded}$ exhibiting large curvature fluctuations (or lacking a uniform positive lower bound), which induce high spatial variance Var$(\hat{C}_{target}(v))$ (Theorem C.3), incur significant penalties violating resource efficiency (R3) and/or local viability (R1):

* **(i) Excess Operational Cost (R3 Violation):** High Var$(\hat{C}_{target}(v))$ forces the adapted MPU complexities $C_v = \langle \hat{C}_v \rangle$ to also exhibit high spatial variance Var$(C_v)$, as $C_v$ must track $\hat{C}_{target}(v)$ via the adaptation dynamics (Equation 30, driven by $\Psi$ which depends on $\hat{C}_{target}$). Let $f(C_v) = \langle \lambda \hat{R}(C_v) + \hat{R}_I(C_v) \rangle_{\rho^{(v)}}$ represent the local expected operational cost rate associated with complexity $C_v$. The physical cost function $R(C)$ is strictly convex ($\gamma_p>1$), while $R_I(C)$ is concave (Definition 3). For the total cost $f(C)$ to be convex ($f''(C) > 0$), we require $\lambda R''(C) > |R_I''(C)|$. This condition is satisfied if the **Dominance of Stabilizing Costs (DSC)** assumption (introduced in the proof of Theorem 22, Equation 34b) holds, ensuring $f''(C) \ge f''_{min} > 0$. This convexity reflects that fundamental costs increase super-linearly with complexity. The total operational cost across the network is $V_{op} = \sum_{v=1}^N f(C_v)$. By Jensen's inequality for convex functions, $\frac{1}{N}\sum f(C_v) \ge f(\frac{1}{N}\sum C_v)$, or $V_{op} \ge N f(\bar{C})$, where $\bar{C}$ is the average complexity. A second-order Taylor expansion around $\bar{C}$ clarifies the variance penalty: $f(C_v) \approx f(\bar{C}) + f'(\bar{C})(C_v-\bar{C}) + \frac{1}{2}f''(\bar{C})(C_v-\bar{C})^2$. Summing over $v$: $V_{op} \approx N f(\bar{C}) + 0 + \frac{1}{2}f''(\bar{C}) \sum (C_v-\bar{C})^2 = N f(\bar{C}) + \frac{N}{2}f''(\bar{C})\text{Var}(C_v)$. The excess cost compared to a uniform configuration where all $C_v = \bar{C}$ is:
$$
\Delta V_{op} = V_{op}[\{C_v\}] - V_{op}[\{\bar{C}\}] \approx \frac{N}{2}f''(\bar{C})\text{Var}(C_v) \ge \frac{N}{2}f''_{min}\text{Var}(C_v)
\quad \text{(C.15)}
$$
Since $f''_{min} > 0$, large Var$(C_v)$ (driven by large Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ or absence of uniform positive bound) leads to a significant excess operational cost $\Delta V_{op}$. This excess $\Delta V_{op}$ directly contributes to a higher $V_{op}(x)$ component in the PCE Potential (Definition D.1), representing an inefficient allocation of resources penalized by PCE, thus violating R3.
* **(ii) Reduced Local Stability (R1 Violation):** High variance Var$(C_v)$ means a significant fraction of MPUs operate far from the average complexity $\bar{C}$. Furthermore, large and rapid fluctuations in the local target $\hat{C}_{target}(v)$ (due to curvature fluctuations) make it difficult for the adaptation dynamics ($dC/dt = \eta_{adapt} \Psi$, Equation 30) to precisely track the instantaneous local optimum $C^*(v)$. This leads to larger transient mismatches $|C_v(t) - C^*(v, t)|$. Such mismatches cause the actual performance $PP(C_v, \hat{C}_{target}(v))$ to deviate from the target $PP_{op}$, potentially falling below $\alpha$ or exceeding $\beta$. Let $p_{fail}(v)$ be the probability that MPU $v$ violates the viability bounds $(\alpha, \beta)$ over a characteristic adaptation timescale. This probability increases with the magnitude and frequency of the adaptation mismatch, which scales with Var$(C_v)$ (driven by Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$). Assuming failures are approximately independent across distant MPUs in a large network, the probability that the entire network remains viable (all MPUs satisfy R1) is $P_{stability} = \prod_{v=1}^N (1 - p_{fail}(v))$. If the average failure probability scales with variance, $\langle p_{fail} \rangle \approx c_{fail} \text{Var}(C_v)$ for some constant $c_{fail}>0$, then for large N:
$$
P_{stability} \approx (1 - c_{fail} \text{Var}(C_v))^N \approx \exp(-N c_{fail} \text{Var}(C_v))
\quad \text{(C.16)}
$$
Stability decays exponentially with network size $N$ and the complexity variance Var$(C_v)$. High curvature fluctuations, by inducing high Var$(C_v)$, make widespread local viability failures highly probable in large networks, thus violating R1.

*Proof:*
* **(i)** The derivation relies on the convexity of the operational cost function $f(C)$ with respect to complexity $C$. Jensen's inequality or a Taylor expansion directly shows that variance in complexity leads to an increased average cost compared to the cost at the average complexity. The minimum second derivative $f''_{min}$ being positive ensures this penalty is non-zero.
* **(ii)** The argument connects large variance in the target complexity $\hat{C}_{target}$ to increased errors in the adaptive tracking of the optimal complexity $C^*$. These errors cause performance deviations. Assuming a relationship between variance and the probability of performance boundary violation $p_{fail}$, the exponential decay of overall stability $P_{stability}$ follows from standard reliability theory for systems composed of many components susceptible to failure.

**C.6 Synthesized Necessity Argument**

We now combine the results to demonstrate formally that geometric regularity is necessary for viability.

 **Definition C.4 (Viability Functional).** Let $\mathcal{C} = (\mathcal{N}, \{C_v\}, \rho_{agg})$ represent a complete configuration of the MPU network. We define the Viability Functional $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] \in [0, \infty)$ which quantifies the degree to which configuration $\mathcal{C}$ simultaneously satisfies the core requirements R1, R2, and R3. A configuration is viable only if all requirements are met. We define $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}]$ such that $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] \ge 1$ indicates viability, using normalized measures for each requirement:
 $$
    \mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] = \min\left\{ R_1[\mathcal{C}], R_2[\mathcal{C}], R_3[\mathcal{C}] \right\}
    \quad \text{(C.17)}
    $$
where:
*   **$R_2[\mathcal{C}]$ (Global Coherence):** A measure reflecting the maintenance of predictive coherence across the network. $R_2[\mathcal{C}] = MP_{Global}[\mathcal{C}] / MP_{min}$, where $MP_{min}$ is the minimum required coherence level. Requires $R_2 \ge 1$.
*   **$R_3[\mathcal{C}]$ (Resource Efficiency):** A measure reflecting cost efficiency. $R_3[\mathcal{C}] = V_{max} / V_{total}[\mathcal{C}]$, where $V_{total}[\mathcal{C}]$ is the total effective cost rate (e.g., from PCE Potential $V(x)$ components related to operation and propagation) and $V_{max}$ is the maximum sustainable rate based on available resources. Requires $R_3 \ge 1$.

**Definition C.5 (Viable Configuration).** A configuration $\mathcal{C}$ is viable if and only if it satisfies all core requirements simultaneously, represented by the condition $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] \ge 1$.

 **Theorem C.5 (Quantitative Non-Viability of Irregular Geometries).** If an MPU network configuration $\mathcal{C}$ exhibits significant geometric irregularity (violating Def C.1 or Def C.2 as refined in Def C.3), then its Viability Functional $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}]$ falls below 1 for sufficiently large system size $L$ or sufficiently large curvature variance Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ (or absence of $\kappa_R > 0$). Such configurations are non-viable.

*Proof:*
1.  **Consequences of Irregularity:** Geometric irregularity means either anomalous dimension (violating Def C.1) or failure to maintain a positive lower bound on Ricci curvature and/or presence of large curvature fluctuations (violating Def C.2 as refined in Def C.3), or both.
2.  **Impact of Anomalous Dimension:** If Def C.1 is violated, then by Theorem C.2, for sufficiently large $L$, either global coherence $MP_{Global}$ falls below $MP_{min}$ (forcing $R_2[\mathcal{C}] < 1$) or resource cost $V_{total}[\mathcal{C}]$ (due to $V_{prop}$) exceeds $V_{max}$ (forcing $R_3[\mathcal{C}] < 1$).
3.  **Impact of Curvature Issues:** If Def C.2 (as refined by Def C.3, requiring $\kappa_R>0$ and bounded variance) is violated (e.g., large Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$ or $\kappa_R \le 0$ in significant regions), then by Theorem C.4, for sufficiently large $N$ or Var$(\kappa_{\mathcal{N}})$, either the excess operational cost makes the total cost $V_{total}[\mathcal{C}]$ (due to $V_{op}$) exceed $V_{max}$ (forcing $R_3[\mathcal{C}] < 1$) or the network stability $P_{stability}$ falls below $P_{min_stability}$ (forcing $R_1[\mathcal{C}] < 1$).
4.  **Minimum Condition:** Since $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] = \min\{R_1, R_2, R_3\}$ (Eq. C.17), if any requirement $R_i$ falls below 1 due to irregularity, then $\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}]$ must be less than 1.
5.  **Conclusion:** Significant geometric irregularity inevitably leads to the violation of at least one core requirement (R1, R2, or R3) under sufficiently challenging conditions (large size or high variance/insufficient positive curvature), rendering the configuration non-viable according to Definition C.5 ($\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] < 1$). QED

**Corollary C.1 (Asymptotic Non-Viability).** There exist finite thresholds for system size $L_{crit}$ and curvature variance $\kappa_{var,crit}$ (or degree of violation of $\kappa_R>0$) such that any configuration exhibiting geometric irregularity exceeding these thresholds is guaranteed to be non-viable ($\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] < 1$).

*Proof:* Follows directly from the finite critical scales ($L_{crit}^{(R2)}$) derived or implied in the proofs of Theorems C.2 and C.4, which show that violations become inevitable beyond certain thresholds of irregularity. QED

**Theorem C.6 (PU ⇒ local doubling + (1,2)–Poincaré with constants)**

This theorem strengthens the necessity statement of Theorem 43 by providing a direct, constructive proof of geometric regularity from the framework's microscopic principles. Let $(\mathcal{N},d_{\mathcal{N}},\mu)$ be the predictive network endowed with the cost‑metric $d_{\mathcal{N}}$ and counting measure $\mu$ coarse‑grained at resolution $\delta$ (App. E/Q). Assume:

1. **Uniform PCE saturation**: On every ball $B(x,r)$ with $r\ge 10\delta$, the per‑edge capacity weights $w_e$ satisfy
   $\displaystyle 1-\varepsilon_C \le \frac{w_e}{C^*_{\max}}\le 1+\varepsilon_C,\qquad C^*_{\max}=2\ln 2,$
   with $\varepsilon_C \le \frac{1-f_{\mathrm{RID}}}{1+f_{\mathrm{RID}}}$ (from the KKT stationarity of POP with RID contractivity $f_{\mathrm{RID}}$ from Lemma E.1).
2. **Bounded geometry**: Node degree $\Delta\_{\min}\le \deg(v)\le \Delta\_{\max}$, packing $\eta$ and link‑area density $\chi$ as in App. E/Q; minimal link length $\delta$.

Then for all $r\ge 10\delta$ and $x\in\mathcal{N}$:

* (Doubling)

$$
\mu\!\left(B(x,2r)\right)\ \le\ D_\star\ \mu\!\left(B(x,r)\right),\qquad
D_\star\ :=\ 2^{D}\left(1+4\varepsilon_C\right)\frac{\Delta_{\max}}{\Delta_{\min}}\frac{\eta^\uparrow}{\eta^\downarrow},
$$

where $\eta^\uparrow/\eta^\downarrow$ bounds local packing variation at scale $r$.

* ((1,2)–Poincaré, λ‑local) there exist $\lambda=4$ and

$$
C_P(r)\ :=\ \frac{\sqrt{2\,\Delta_{\max}}}{3\,\chi}\,
\frac{(1+\varepsilon_C)}{(1-\varepsilon_C)}\,\frac{\rho^\uparrow(r)}{\rho^\downarrow(r)}\,,
$$

such that for every locally Lipschitz $f$

$$
\fint_{B(x,r)}\!\!\!|f-f_{B(x,r)}|\,\mathrm d\mu\ \le\
C_P(r)\,r \left(\fint_{B(x,4r)} |\nabla f|^2\,\mathrm d\mu\right)^{1/2}.
$$

*Proof sketch.*
(i) *Local homogeneity from PCE + RID.* KKT stationarity of POP under RID contractivity gives a uniformity modulus
$\varepsilon_C\le(1-f_{\mathrm{RID}})/(1+f_{\mathrm{RID}})$ for the optimal link weights. This bounds local density fluctuations of nodes/links at scale $\ge 10\delta$.
(ii) *Doubling.* Pack $B(x,2r)$ by $2^{D}$ disjoint translates of $B(x,r)$ up to packing distortion $\eta^\uparrow/\eta^\downarrow$ and degree distortion $\Delta_{\max}/\Delta_{\min}$. The weight uniformity adds a factor $(1+4\varepsilon_C)$.
(iii) *Cheeger–Poincaré.* The graph‑Cheeger constant on $B(x,r)$ satisfies
$h(B)\ge \frac{w_{\min}\,\chi\,4\pi r^2}{w_{\max}\,\rho^\uparrow(r)\,\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3} = \frac{3\chi}{\rho^\uparrow(r)}\,\frac{(1-\varepsilon_C)}{r(1+\varepsilon_C)}$.
Cheeger’s inequality gives $\lambda_1(B)\ge h(B)^2/(2\Delta_{\max})$. Combine $\mathrm{Var}_B(f)\le \lambda_1(B)^{-1}\mathcal{E}(f,f)$ with $\mathcal{E}(f,f)$ bounded by the coarse‑grained Dirichlet form to obtain the stated $(1,2)$–Poincaré with $\lambda=4$ and $C_P(r)$ above.  $\square$

**C.7 Conclusion**


This appendix has rigorously demonstrated, through quantitative analysis of the impact of geometric irregularities on the core operational requirements (R1: Local Viability, R2: Global Coherence, R3: Resource Efficiency), that large-scale geometric regularity (Definition C.3)—which includes uniform D-dimensional volume growth and a PU-derived positive lower bound on discrete Ricci curvature with bounded variance (Section C.3)—is a necessary condition (Theorem C.6) for the viability and self-consistency of MPU networks operating under the principles of the Predictive Universe framework (POP, PCE, Axiom 3). Anomalous dimension leads inevitably to the breakdown of global predictive coherence and/or unsustainable propagation costs (Theorem C.2). Failure to maintain a sufficiently positive and uniform Ricci curvature (or having large curvature fluctuations) induces excessive operational costs and destabilizes local MPU dynamics (Theorem C.4). Configurations suffering from these irregularities are demonstrably non-viable ($\mathcal{V}[\mathcal{C}] < 1$, Theorem C.5). This finding justifies Theorem 43 and provides the crucial foundation for assuming an emergent regular geometric background in the subsequent derivation of a continuous spacetime manifold (Section 11) and its gravitational dynamics (Section 12). Regularity is not an arbitrary assumption but a prerequisite imposed by the functional demands of efficient, stable, large-scale prediction.
