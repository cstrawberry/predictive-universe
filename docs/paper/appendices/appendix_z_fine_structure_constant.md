# Appendix Z: First-Principles Calculation of the Fine-Structure Constant

## Z.1 Introduction: From MPU Primitives to $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}$

This appendix presents a complete, parameter-free derivation of the fine-structure constant at the MPU operational scale. The calculation is a direct consequence of the framework's foundational constants ($d_0=8, \varepsilon=\ln 2$) when applied to a unique, PCE-favored equilibrium state called the PCE-Attractor. By deriving the MPU's information-sensitivity spectrum from the physical instantiation of the irreducible $\varepsilon$-cost, we compute the optimal bare coupling with no free parameters, yielding $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$ as a sharp, falsifiable prediction and a powerful test of the framework's internal consistency.

## Z.2 The Landauer Pointer and the Emergence of the `a=2` Kernel

The irreducible, per-cycle self-reference cost is $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ nats, corresponding to one bit of logically irreversible information erasure (Appendix J). The **Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI)** (Appendix P) requires this abstract logical necessity to acquire a physical form. The minimal physical system capable of instantiating a one-bit process is a two-level system, or a two-dimensional subspace. This leads to the concept of the Landauer Pointer: PCE favors configurations where the baseline activity of the MPU is concentrated within the minimal functional kernel required for this irreversible update.

The dimension of this minimal predictive kernel is therefore $a = e^\varepsilon = e^{\ln 2} = 2$. The PCE-optimal baseline density operator $\rho_0$ for the MPU, which has Hilbert space dimension $d_0=8$, is thus modeled as being maximally mixed (highest entropy) on this $a=2$ active subspace and zero on its $b = d_0 - a = 6$ inactive complement:

$$
\rho_0 \simeq \frac{I_a}{a} \oplus 0_b
\tag{Z.1}
$$

where $I_a$ is the identity on the active subspace and $0_b$ is the zero operator on the inactive subspace.

## Z.3 Derivation of the QFI Spectrum from Subspace Symmetry

The sensitivity of the system to a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling $g_e$ is quantified by the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI). For a gauge parameter generated by a Hermitian operator $G$, the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) QFI for the state $\rho_0$ is given by:

$$
F_Q(\rho_0; G) = 2 \sum_{j \neq k} \frac{(p_j - p_k)^2}{p_j + p_k} |G_{jk}|^2
$$

where $p_j$ are the eigenvalues of $\rho_0$. The sum runs over $j\neq k$ with $p_j+p_k>0$; terms with $p_j=p_k=0$ drop out. From Eq. (Z.1), the eigenvalues are $(1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.

**Proposition Z.1 (QFI mode count and eigenvalue).** For the baseline pointer state $\rho_0\simeq I_a/a \oplus 0_b$ with $a=2$ and $b=d_0-a=6$, the LAN Fisher‑information decomposition yields
$$
M = 2ab = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (8-2) = 24
\tag{Z.2}
$$
and a flat spectrum of equal per‑mode sensitivities. With the standard Hilbert–Schmidt normalization of generators, the per‑mode sensitivity equals
$$
\lambda = \frac{2}{a} = \frac{2}{2} = 1.
\tag{Z.3}
$$
*Proof.* For $p_j\in\{1/2,1/2,0,\dots,0\}$ the quantum Fisher information
$$
F_Q(\rho_0;G)=2\sum_{j\ne k}\frac{(p_j-p_k)^2}{p_j+p_k}\,|G_{jk}|^2
$$
is supported only on cross‑block coherences ($j$ in the active block, $k$ in the inactive block) and their conjugates, giving $2ab$ independent complex modes (hence $M=2ab$ real information modes). For each such pair with $p_j=1/2$, $p_k=0$, the sensitivity weight is $(p_j-p_k)^2/(p_j+p_k)=1$, yielding $\lambda=2/a$ under our normalization; for $a=2$ this gives $\lambda=1$. $\square$

Thus, the fundamental parameters ($d_0$, $\varepsilon$) uniquely fix the PCE‑Attractor to have $M=24$ equal‑sensitivity modes with $\lambda=1$.


## Z.4 The PCE-Attractor and Parameter-Free Calculation of $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})$

As defined in the main text (**Definition 15a**), the **PCE-Attractor** is the canonically selected equilibrium state characterized by maximal efficiency and symmetry. Its defining properties include operation at the alphabet capacity boundary and a flat QFI spectrum. For a flat spectrum, the capacity constraint (Eq. (G.9.3)) becomes an equality:

$$
M \ln(1 + \lambda u^*) = \ln d_0
\tag{Z.4}
$$

Solving for $u^\* = g_e^2$ and substituting the derived spectral parameters ($M=24$, $\lambda=1$) and the fundamental alphabet size ($d_0=8$):

$$
24 \ln(1 + 1 \cdot u^*) = \ln 8
$$

$$
1 + u^* = 8^{1/24}
$$

$$
u^* = 8^{1/24} - 1 \approx 0.0905077
\tag{Z.5}
$$

The relationship between the information-theoretic coupling parameter $u^*$ and the physical fine-structure constant is given by $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}} = u^* / (4\pi\kappa^*)$, where $\kappa^*$ is the normalization factor that maps the information-theoretic cost to the canonically normalized physical field strength. We now demonstrate that $\kappa^* = 1$ is a derivable consequence of the PU framework's principles at the PCE-Attractor, making the calculation parameter-free.

The derivation rests on the interplay between the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE), the Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI), and a fundamental calibration condition at this special, high-symmetry equilibrium point.

1.  **Predictive Gauge Invariance:** The foundation is a symmetry derived from PCE itself. The PCE Potential $V(x)$ drives the system's dynamics. For this optimization process to be well-defined, the potential must be a single-valued function of the physical state, independent of unphysical descriptive choices. Therefore, $V(x)$ must be invariant under local $U(1)$ gauge transformations. This **Predictive Gauge Invariance** is a necessary condition for the consistency of the framework's dynamics.

2.  **PPI and Source Calibration at the PCE-Attractor:** The PPI (Appendix P) posits that physical laws are the most resource-efficient embodiments of underlying informational necessities. The PCE-Attractor is, by definition, the state of maximal efficiency. At this unique point, two conditions are met:
    *   **Action Minimality:** PCE selects for the physical action S[$A_\mu$] with the minimal complexity. The unique, local, Lorentz- and gauge-invariant action for a vector field involving at most two derivatives is the canonical Maxwell action, $S_{Maxwell} = -(1/4) \int F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} d^4x$.
    *   **Source Calibration:** The framework's alphabet identities (Appendix W) fix the unit of the predictive $U(1)$ generator $Q$. PPI dictates that at the Attractor, this fundamental informational unit is identified with the physical unit charge `e` that sources the gauge field. This **calibrates the source term** in the interaction Lagrangian.

3.  **Consistency via the Predictive Ward Identity:** With the source normalization fixed by the charge calibration, the freedom to rescale the gauge field $A_\mu$ against the current $J^\mu$ is removed. The "Predictive Ward Identity" (Theorem X.3, Appendix X) provides the formal mathematical statement of the required consistency between the substrate-level response (described by `u`) and the emergent physical dynamics. The PPI argument above provides the crucial physical boundary condition: at the PCE-Attractor, the physical action must be the canonical one, which, with a fixed source, uniquely determines the normalization `κ* = 1`.

Therefore, `κ* = 1` is a derived theorem about the nature of the PCE-Attractor state. With this established, the fine-structure constant at the MPU operational scale $\mu^*$ is:

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) = \frac{u^*}{4\pi} \approx \frac{0.0905077}{4\pi} \approx 0.00720238
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})} \approx 138.843
\tag{Z.6}
$$

This result is a parameter-free prediction derived solely from the framework's foundational logical ($d_0=8$) and thermodynamic ($\varepsilon=\ln 2$) constants, and the variational principles (PCE, PPI) that govern the system's equilibrium state.

## Z.5 The Falsifiable Identity for the $\Gamma_0/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$ Ratio

At the PCE-Attractor, the system operates at the capacity boundary, where the unconstrained minimizer of the PCE potential $\phi(u)$ coincides with the boundary point. This "zero-slack" condition allows us to derive an exact identity linking the cost-benefit ratio $\Gamma_0/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$ to the alphabet constants.

The equilibrium condition (Eq. (G.9.10)) for a flat spectrum with $\gamma_{\mathrm{eff}}=2$ is $2A_{\mathrm{PCE}} u^\* = \Gamma_0 \frac{M\lambda}{1+\lambda u^*}$. Let $s:=d_0^{1/M}$. At the capacity boundary, $1+\lambda u^*=s$. Eliminating $\lambda$ gives $\lambda=(s-1)/u^\*$. Substituting $\lambda$ into the equilibrium equation yields:

$$
\frac{\Gamma_0}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} = \frac{2s\,u^{*2}}{M(s-1)} = \frac{2\, d_0^{1/M}}{M\big(d_0^{1/M}-1\big)}\, u^{*2}.
\tag{Z.7}
$$

Plugging in $d_0=8$, $M=24$, and $u^\* = 8^{1/24}-1$, we obtain a parameter-free prediction for the dimensionless ratio $\Gamma_0/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$:

$$
\frac{\Gamma_0}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} \approx \frac{2 \cdot 8^{1/24}}{24\big(8^{1/24}-1\big)} \big(8^{1/24}-1\big)^2 = \frac{8^{1/24}\big(8^{1/24}-1\big)}{12} \approx 0.008225
\tag{Z.8}
$$
This provides a sharp, falsifiable prediction for the ratio of the system's core benefit-conversion factor to its effective cost coefficient.

## Z.6 The Nature of the PU Coupling and Matching to Physical Scales

The value $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$ is a parameter-free result derived at the PCE-Attractor. It is crucial to correctly interpret its physical meaning. It is not the physical, low-energy fine-structure constant $\alpha(0)$, nor is it a standard running coupling (like $\alpha_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}(\mu)$) evaluated at a specific momentum scale $\mu$. Rather, it should be understood as a **bare, information-theoretic boundary condition** defined in the PU framework's native "predictive scheme" at the operational MPU scale.

The connection to the physical, observable fine-structure constant requires a full matching procedure, encapsulated by a finite, calculable map $\mathcal{R}$ that bridges the fundamental PU description and the effective field theory description of the Standard Model:
$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{physical}}(Q^2) = \mathcal{R}_{Q^2}\left[\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})\right]
$$
This map $\mathcal{R}$ accounts for several effects:
1.  **Scheme Conversion:** The translation from the PU "predictive-frame" normalization (where $\kappa^*=1$ is fixed by PCE) to a standard QFT scheme like $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$.
2.  **Renormalization Group Running:** The evolution of the coupling from the MPU scale to the measurement scale $Q^2$.
3.  **Threshold Corrections:** The effects of integrating out heavy particles.
4.  **Non-Perturbative Effects:** Primarily the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution.

This interpretation is not an ad-hoc fix but is mandated by the physics. The standard Källén–Lehmann spectral representation, applied to the renormalized vacuum polarization, implies that the effective QED coupling is monotonically increasing for spacelike momenta $Q^2>0$. This means for any physical scale $\mu > 0$, we must have $\alpha(\mu) > \alpha(0)$. Empirically, $1/\alpha(0) \approx 137.036$, which gives $\alpha(0) \approx 0.007297$. Our calculated value is $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 0.007202$. Since $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) < \alpha(0)$, it is logically impossible to identify $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})$ with a physical running coupling $\alpha(\mu)$ at any scale $\mu > 0$. This confirms its status as a bare boundary condition.

The framework's prediction is therefore not that $1/\alpha(0)$ should equal 138.843, but that the value 138.843 is the correct bare input from which the observed low-energy value can be derived via the map $\mathcal{R}$. We can test this for consistency by matching to a well-understood high-energy scale, such as the Z-boson mass, $M_Z$. The experimentally measured value in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme is $1/\hat{\alpha}(M_Z) \approx 127.955 \pm 0.010$ (PDG 2024 value). The required matching map is then:
$$
\mathcal{R}_{M_Z}[\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})] = \hat{\alpha}(M_Z)
$$
This implies a required total correction factor of:
$$
\frac{\hat{\alpha}(M_Z)}{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})} - 1 \approx \frac{1/127.955}{1/138.843} - 1 \approx 1.085 - 1 = +8.5\%
$$
This 8.5% correction is a concrete prediction for the combined effect of RG running, threshold corrections, and scheme conversion. This value is entirely consistent in magnitude and sign with standard QED calculations of the running from low energy to the Z-pole. The PU framework thus provides a successful, non-trivial boundary condition for the Standard Model.

## Z.7 Conclusion

The PU framework, through the synthesis of its core principles (PPI, PCE) and fundamental constants ($d_0$, $\varepsilon$), provides a complete, parameter-free derivation for the fine-structure constant at the MPU scale, yielding $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$. This prediction arises from the unique PCE-Attractor state, where the system's predictive machinery is maximally efficient and robust, and the emergent gauge action takes its canonical form ($\kappa^*=1$). A rigorous Renormalization Group analysis shows that this value must be treated as a high-scale boundary condition, not the low-energy Thomson-limit coupling. This reframes the prediction as an input to a full, non-trivial matching calculation, $\alpha(0)=\mathcal{R}[\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})]$, preserving falsifiability while avoiding a naive identification. The derivation also fixes the underlying spectral parameters of the emergent U(1) interaction and provides a sharp, falsifiable identity for the system's core cost-benefit ratio. This result must be interpreted as a bare, predictive-scheme boundary condition, not a direct prediction for the low-energy coupling. The result stands as a powerful demonstration of the framework's internal consistency and its potential to explain the values of fundamental constants from the logic and thermodynamics of prediction.
