# Appendix Z: First-Principles Calculation of the Fine-Structure Constant

## Z.1 Introduction: From MPU Primitives to $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}$

This appendix presents a complete, parameter-free derivation of the fine-structure constant at the MPU operational scale. The calculation is a direct consequence of the framework's foundational constants ($d_0=8, \varepsilon=\ln 2$) when applied to a unique, PCE-favored equilibrium state called the **PCE-Attractor** (Definition 15a). By deriving the MPU's information-sensitivity spectrum from the physical instantiation of the irreducible $\varepsilon$-cost, we compute the optimal bare coupling with no free parameters, yielding $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$ as a sharp, falsifiable prediction and a powerful test of the framework's internal consistency.

## Z.2 MPU Invariants and the Active Kernel

The derivation begins with the framework's foundational, logically-derived constants:
*   **MPU Hilbert Space Dimension:** $d_0=8$, from the minimal complexity $K_0=3$ bits required for robust self-referential logic (Theorem 23).
*   **Irreducible Cost:** $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ nats, the minimal thermodynamic cost of the logically irreversible state-merge in the SPAP cycle (Theorem 31, rigorously derived in Appendix J).

The **Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI)** (Appendix P) requires this abstract logical cost to acquire a physical form. The minimal physical system capable of instantiating a one-bit process ($\ln 2$ nats) is a two-level system. This leads to the concept of the **Landauer Pointer**: PCE favors configurations where the baseline activity of the MPU is concentrated within the minimal functional kernel required for this irreversible update. The dimension of this minimal active kernel is therefore:
$$
a = e^\varepsilon = e^{\ln 2} = 2.
\tag{Z.1}
$$
The PCE-optimal baseline density operator $\rho_0$ for the MPU is thus modeled as being maximally mixed (highest entropy) on this $a=2$ active subspace and zero on its $b = d_0 - a = 6$ inactive complement:
$$
\rho_0 = \frac{I_a}{a} \oplus 0_b
\tag{Z.2}
$$
where $I_a$ is the identity on the active subspace and $0_b$ is the zero operator on the inactive subspace.

## Z.3 Derivation of the QFI Spectrum from Subspace Symmetry

The sensitivity of the system to a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling $g_e$ is quantified by the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) Quantum Fisher Information (QFI). For a state $\rho_0$ with eigenvalues $p_j$ and a generator $G$, the QFI is:
$$
F_Q(\rho_0; G) = 2 \sum_{j \neq k, p_j+p_k>0} \frac{(p_j - p_k)^2}{p_j + p_k} |G_{jk}|^2
$$
From Equation (Z.2), the eigenvalues of $\rho_0$ are $(1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.

**Proposition Z.1 (QFI Mode Count and Eigenvalue).** For the baseline pointer state $\rho_0 = I_a/a \oplus 0_b$ with $(a,b)=(2,6)$, the Local Asymptotic Normality (LAN) decomposition yields a flat spectrum of information-sensitivity modes characterized by:
*   **Number of Modes:** $M = 2ab = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6 = 24$
*   **Per-Mode Sensitivity:** $\lambda = 2/a = 2/2 = 1$

*Proof.* The QFI is non-zero only for matrix elements $G_{jk}$ that connect the active subspace (where $p_j=1/2$) to the inactive subspace (where $p_k=0$). There are $a \times b = 12$ such pairs. Each pair corresponds to two real, independent modes (from the real and imaginary parts of the off-diagonal element), giving a total of $M=2ab=24$ modes. For each such mode, the sensitivity weight is $(p_j-p_k)^2/(p_j+p_k) = (1/2-0)^2/(1/2+0) = 1/2$. With a standard Hilbert-Schmidt normalization for the generators $G_{jk}$ where $|G_{jk}|^2=1$, the per-mode sensitivity is $\lambda = 2 \times (1/2) \times 1 = 1$. Thus, the fundamental parameters ($d_0, \varepsilon$) uniquely fix the PCE-Attractor to have $M=24$ equal-sensitivity modes with $\lambda=1$. $\square$

## Z.4 The PCE-Attractor and Capacity Saturation

The **PCE-Attractor** (Definition 15a) is the state of maximal efficiency. A key feature of this state is that the system's predictive machinery operates at its absolute physical limit. This limit is the **Operational Alphabet Capacity**, which is the maximum information that can be reliably encoded and retrieved in a single MPU cycle.

**Theorem Z.1 (Operational Alphabet-Capacity Theorem).**
Let the allowed instrument set at the MPU's **Commit Snapshot** include a minimal rank-raising CPTP instrument (realized via Stinespring dilation and reversible control). Then the operational per-cycle alphabet capacity equals $\ln d_0$. The minimal thermodynamic cost to unlock this full capacity is $\Delta S \ge \ln(d_0/a)$, incurred in a preparation/reset stage decoupled from the interaction parameter.

*Proof Sketch.* A unitary-only instrument set can only access $\lfloor d_0/a \rfloor$ orthogonal states, limiting capacity to $\ln \lfloor d_0/a \rfloor$. The rank-raising instrument, physically realized by coupling to an ancilla, allows the preparation of $d_0$ mutually orthogonal states, thus achieving the full capacity $\ln d_0$. The cost is independent of the coupling parameter $u$ because the preparation is part of the baseline cycle, not the interaction itself.

At the PCE-Attractor, the system saturates this capacity. The predictive information gain, given by the surrogate $\mathcal{I}(u) = \sum_i \ln(1+\lambda_i u)$ (from Appendix G.9), must equal this maximum value:
$$
\mathcal{I}(u^*) = \ln d_0
\tag{Z.3}
$$

## Z.5 Calculation of the Bare Coupling `u*`

For the flat spectrum derived in Proposition Z.1 ($M=24, \lambda=1$) and the fundamental alphabet size $d_0=8$, the capacity saturation condition (Z.3) becomes:
$$
24 \ln(1 + 1 \cdot u^*) = \ln 8
$$
Solving for $u^*$:
$$
1 + u^* = 8^{1/24}
$$
$$
u^* = 8^{1/24} - 1 \approx 0.0905077327
\tag{Z.4}
$$
Note that $8^{1/24} = (2^3)^{1/24} = 2^{1/8}$, so this is mathematically identical to $u^* = 2^{1/8}-1$.

## Z.6 From `u*` to `α_em(MPU)`: The Predictive Ward Identity

The parameter $u^*$ is an information-theoretic measure of interaction strength. To relate it to the physical fine-structure constant, we invoke the **Predictive Ward Identity** (Theorem X.3, Appendix X). This identity, a consequence of the framework's internal consistency, requires that the emergent physical effective action correctly reproduces the underlying predictive statistics.

The Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI, Appendix P) provides the crucial boundary condition. At the PCE-Attractor—the state of maximal efficiency and symmetry—the emergent physical action must take its simplest, most direct, and canonically normalized form. For a $U(1)$ gauge field, this is the standard Maxwell action. This requirement, enforced by the Ward Identity, uniquely fixes the normalization constant $\kappa^*$ relating the predictive and physical schemes to unity: $\kappa^*=1$.

Therefore, at the MPU operational scale $\mu^*$, the physical coupling $g_e^2$ is identical to the predictive parameter $u^*$, and the fine-structure constant is:
$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) = \frac{u^*}{4\pi} = \frac{8^{1/24}-1}{4\pi} \approx 0.0072023765
$$
$$
\frac{1}{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})} \approx 138.84306
\tag{Z.5}
$$

## Z.7 Consistency Check: Matching to the Z-Pole

The value in (Z.5) is a **bare boundary condition** in the PU's native "predictive scheme," not a physical running coupling. To test for consistency, we match it to the experimental value of the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ coupling at the Z-boson mass, $\hat\alpha(M_Z) = 1/(127.930 \pm 0.008)$ [PDG 2024].

The total finite matching factor required to connect the PU boundary value to the experimental target is:
$$
\frac{\hat\alpha(M_Z)}{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})} - 1 = \frac{138.84306}{127.930} - 1 \approx 0.0853045 \pm 0.0000678
\tag{Z.6}
$$
This required correction of **+8.53%** is a concrete prediction for the combined effect of Renormalization Group running, threshold corrections, and scheme conversion between the MPU scale and the Z-pole. This value is entirely consistent in sign and magnitude with standard QED calculations of these effects, providing a powerful, non-trivial consistency check for the framework.


## Z.8 Falsifiable Identity for the Cost/Benefit Ratio

At the PCE-Attractor, the system operates at the capacity boundary in a "zero-slack" or "Attractor-stationary" state, where the unconstrained minimizer of the PCE potential $\phi(u)$ coincides with the boundary point. This condition yields a parameter-free prediction for the ratio of the framework's core benefit-conversion factor $\Gamma_0$ to its effective cost coefficient $A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$. From Appendix W (Equation W.2.6 and surrounding derivation), this identity is:
$$
\frac{\Gamma_0}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} = \frac{2 d_0^{1/M}}{M(d_0^{1/M}-1)} (u^*)^2
\tag{Z.7}
$$
Substituting $d_0=8$, $M=24$, and $u^* = 8^{1/24}-1$:
$$
\frac{\Gamma_0}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} = \frac{2 \cdot 8^{1/24}}{24(8^{1/24}-1)} (8^{1/24}-1)^2 = \frac{8^{1/24}(8^{1/24}-1)}{12} \approx 0.0082249
\tag{Z.8}
$$
This provides another sharp, falsifiable prediction derived from the Attractor state.

## Z.9 Conclusion

The PU framework, through the synthesis of its core principles (PPI, PCE) and fundamental constants ($d_0$, $\varepsilon$), provides a complete, parameter-free derivation for the fine-structure constant at the MPU scale, yielding $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$. This prediction arises from the unique PCE-Attractor state, where the system's predictive machinery is maximally efficient and robust, and the emergent gauge action takes its canonical form ($\kappa^*=1$) as a consequence of the Predictive Ward Identity. A rigorous Renormalization Group analysis shows that this value must be treated as a high-scale boundary condition. The required finite matching factor to connect this value to the observed coupling at the Z-pole is consistent with Standard Model calculations. The result stands as a powerful demonstration of the framework's internal consistency and its potential to explain the values of fundamental constants from the logic and thermodynamics of prediction.
