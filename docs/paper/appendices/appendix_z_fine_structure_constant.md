# Appendix Z: First-Principles Calculation of the Fine-Structure Constant

## Z.1 Introduction: From MPU Primitives to $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}$

This appendix presents a first-principles, parameter-free derivation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}$ at the MPU operational scale. The calculation is a direct consequence of the framework's most fundamental constants—the MPU alphabet size $d_0 = 8$ (Theorem 23) and the irreducible thermodynamic cost $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ (Theorem 31)—when applied to the **PCE-Attractor**. This attractor is an idealized, high-symmetry equilibrium state favored by PCE, characterized by a flat information-sensitivity spectrum and operation at the MPU's maximum information capacity. As rigorously justified in **Appendix X**, the optimization of the rate-level PCE potential under this capacity constraint is equivalent to finding the minimum of the full QFT effective potential. By deriving the spectral parameters ($M$, $\lambda$) from the physical instantiation of the $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ cost, we compute the optimal bare coupling $u^\* = g_e^2$ and hence $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})$ with no free parameters. This provides a powerful internal consistency check and a sharp, falsifiable prediction.

## Z.2 The Landauer Pointer and the Emergence of the `a=2` Kernel

The irreducible, per-cycle self-reference cost is $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ nats, corresponding to one bit of logically irreversible information erasure (Appendix J). The **Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI)** (Appendix P) requires this abstract logical necessity to acquire a physical form. The minimal physical system capable of instantiating a one-bit process is a two-level system, or a two-dimensional subspace. This leads to the concept of the Landauer Pointer: PCE favors configurations where the baseline activity of the MPU is concentrated within the minimal functional kernel required for this irreversible update.

The dimension of this minimal predictive kernel is therefore $a = e^\varepsilon = e^{\ln 2} = 2$. The PCE-optimal baseline density operator $\rho_0$ for the MPU, which has Hilbert space dimension $d_0=8$, is thus modeled as being maximally mixed (highest entropy) on this $a=2$ active subspace and zero on its $b = d_0 - a = 6$ inactive complement:

$$
\rho_0 \simeq \frac{I_a}{a} \oplus 0_b
\tag{Z.1}
$$

where $I_a$ is the identity on the active subspace and $0_b$ is the zero operator on the inactive subspace.

## Z.3 Derivation of the QFI Spectrum from Subspace Symmetry

The sensitivity of the system to a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling $g_e$ is quantified by the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI). For a gauge parameter generated by a Hermitian operator $G$, the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) QFI for the state $\rho_0$ is given by:

$$
F_Q(\rho_0; G) = 2 \sum_{j \neq k} \frac{(p_j - p_k)^2}{p_j + p_k} |G_{jk}|^2
$$

where $p_j$ are the eigenvalues of $\rho_0$. The sum runs over $j\neq k$ with $p_j+p_k>0$; terms with $p_j=p_k=0$ drop out. From Eq. (Z.1), the eigenvalues are $(1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.

* **Mode Structure:** The QFI is non-zero only for generators $G$ that couple the active ($a=2$) and inactive ($b=6$) subspaces, as generators acting purely within either block commute with $\rho_0$ and yield zero QFI. These off-block-diagonal generators come in pairs (analogous to $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ for each $a-b$ link), giving a total number of independent, information-carrying modes:

  $$
  M = 2ab = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (8-2) = 24
  \tag{Z.2}
  $$
* **Flat Spectrum:** The baseline state $\rho_0$ is invariant under $U(a) \times U(b)$ transformations. This symmetry implies that all $M=24$ off-block information-carrying modes are equivalent. Therefore, their corresponding QFI eigenvalues must be equal, resulting in a **flat spectrum**.
* **Eigenvalue `λ`:** With a standard Hilbert-Schmidt normalization for the generators ($\mathrm{Tr},G^2=1$), the QFI for each of these $M$ modes can be calculated. The non-zero eigenvalues $p_j$ and $p_k$ are $1/2$ and $0$. The resulting eigenvalue is:

  $$
  \lambda = \frac{2}{a} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
  \tag{Z.3}
  $$

Thus, the fundamental parameters ($d_0$, $\varepsilon$) uniquely determine the QFI spectrum of the MPU at the PCE-Attractor to be $M=24$ modes, each with sensitivity $\lambda=1$.

## Z.4 The PCE-Attractor and Parameter-Free Calculation of $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})$

The PCE-Attractor is the equilibrium state where the system is maximally efficient, which corresponds to operating at the alphabet capacity boundary (Appendix W). For a flat spectrum, the capacity constraint (Eq. (G.9.3)) becomes an equality:

$$
M \ln(1 + \lambda u^*) = \ln d_0
\tag{Z.4}
$$

Solving for $u^\* = g_e^2$ and substituting the derived spectral parameters ($M=24$, $\lambda=1$) and the fundamental alphabet size ($d_0=8$):

$$
24 \ln(1 + 1 \cdot u^*) = \ln 8
$$

$$
1 + u^* = 8^{1/24}
$$

$$
u^* = 8^{1/24} - 1 \approx 0.0905077
\tag{Z.5}
$$

The relationship between the information-theoretic coupling parameter $u^*$ and the physical fine-structure constant is given by $\alpha_{\mathrm{em}} = u^* / (4\pi\kappa^*)$, where $\kappa^*$ is the normalization factor that maps the information-theoretic cost to the canonically normalized physical field strength. We now demonstrate that $\kappa^* = 1$ is a derivable consequence of the PU framework's principles at the PCE-Attractor, making the calculation parameter-free.

The derivation rests on the interplay between the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE), the Principle of Physical Instantiation (PPI), and a fundamental calibration condition at this special, high-symmetry equilibrium point.

1.  **Predictive Gauge Invariance:** The foundation is a symmetry derived from PCE itself. The PCE Potential $V(x)$ drives the system's dynamics. For this optimization process to be well-defined, the potential must be a single-valued function of the physical state, independent of unphysical descriptive choices. Therefore, $V(x)$ must be invariant under local $U(1)$ gauge transformations. This **Predictive Gauge Invariance** is a necessary condition for the consistency of the framework's dynamics.

2.  **PPI and Source Calibration at the PCE-Attractor:** The PPI (Appendix P) posits that physical laws are the most resource-efficient embodiments of underlying informational necessities. The PCE-Attractor is, by definition, the state of maximal efficiency. At this unique point, two conditions are met:
    *   **Action Minimality:** PCE selects for the physical action S[$A_\mu$] with the minimal complexity. The unique, local, Lorentz- and gauge-invariant action for a vector field involving at most two derivatives is the canonical Maxwell action, $S_{Maxwell} = -(1/4) \int F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} d^4x$.
    *   **Source Calibration:** The framework's alphabet identities (Appendix W) fix the unit of the predictive $U(1)$ generator $Q$. PPI dictates that at the Attractor, this fundamental informational unit is identified with the physical unit charge `e` that sources the gauge field. This **calibrates the source term** in the interaction Lagrangian.

3.  **Consistency via the Predictive Ward Identity:** With the source normalization fixed by the charge calibration, the freedom to rescale the gauge field $A_\mu$ against the current $J^\mu$ is removed. The "Predictive Ward Identity" (Theorem X.3, Appendix X) provides the formal mathematical statement of the required consistency between the substrate-level response (described by `u`) and the emergent physical dynamics. The PPI argument above provides the crucial physical boundary condition: at the PCE-Attractor, the physical action must be the canonical one, which, with a fixed source, uniquely determines the normalization `κ* = 1`.

Therefore, `κ* = 1` is a derived theorem about the nature of the PCE-Attractor state. With this established, the fine-structure constant at the MPU operational scale $\mu^*$ is:

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) = \frac{u^*}{4\pi} \approx \frac{0.0905077}{4\pi} \approx 0.007202
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU})} \approx 138.843
\tag{Z.6}
$$

This result is a parameter-free prediction derived solely from the framework's foundational logical ($d_0=8$) and thermodynamic ($\varepsilon=\ln 2$) constants, and the variational principles (PCE, PPI) that govern the system's equilibrium state.

## Z.5 The Falsifiable Identity for the $\Gamma_0/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$ Ratio

At the PCE-Attractor, the system operates at the capacity boundary, where the unconstrained minimizer of the PCE potential $\phi(u)$ coincides with the boundary point. This "zero-slack" condition allows us to derive an exact identity linking the cost-benefit ratio $\Gamma_0/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$ to the alphabet constants.

The equilibrium condition (Eq. (G.9.10)) for a flat spectrum with $\gamma_{\mathrm{eff}}=2$ is $2A_{\mathrm{PCE}} u^\* = \Gamma_0\nu \frac{M\lambda}{1+\lambda u^*}$. Let $s:=d_0^{1/M}$. At the capacity boundary, $1+\lambda u^*=s$. Eliminating $\lambda$ gives $\lambda=(s-1)/u^\*$. Substituting $\lambda$ into the equilibrium equation yields:

$$
\frac{\Gamma_0 \nu}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} = \frac{2s\,u^{*2}}{M(s-1)} = \frac{2\, d_0^{1/M}}{M\big(d_0^{1/M}-1\big)}\, u^{*2}.
\tag{Z.7}
$$

Plugging in $d_0=8$, $M=24$, and $u^\* = 8^{1/24}-1$, we obtain a parameter-free prediction for the dimensionless ratio $(\Gamma_0\nu)/A_{\mathrm{PCE}}$:

$$
\frac{\Gamma_0 \nu}{A_{\mathrm{PCE}}} \approx \frac{2 \cdot 8^{1/24}}{24\big(8^{1/24}-1\big)} \big(8^{1/24}-1\big)^2 = \frac{8^{1/24}\big(8^{1/24}-1\big)}{12} \approx 0.008225
\tag{Z.8}
$$

This provides a sharp, falsifiable prediction for the ratio of the system's core benefit-conversion factor to its effective cost coefficient.

## Z.6 Reconciliation with Observation via Renormalization Group Flow

Define the **matching scale** $\mu^\*$ as the stationary point of the gauge‑sector effective potential subject to the PCE capacity constraint (Appendix X):
$$
\frac{d}{du}\Big(V_{\rm eff}(u;k)+\zeta\,[M\ln(1+\lambda u)-\ln d_0]\Big)\Big|_{u=u^*,\,k=\mu^\*}=0,
\qquad \alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(k)=\frac{u(k)}{4\pi\,\kappa(k)}\ \text{(X.6)}.
\tag{Z.6a}
$$
At $k=\mu^\*$ we have $u(\mu^\*)=u^*$ (Appendix Z.4) and the background‑field normalization $\kappa(\mu^\*)=\kappa_\*$ from (X.5)–(X.6). The alphabet/flat‑spectrum identities (Appendix W) fix the $O(1)$ factors **at the PCE attractor** (capacity saturation),
$$
F_\lambda(\mu^\*)=1,\qquad \frac{C_{\rm cyc}}{C_{\rm cap}}(\mu^\*)=1,
\tag{Z.6b}
$$
These equalities hold at the flat‑spectrum, capacity‑saturated PCE attractor; off‑attractor deviations appear as $O(\Delta_{\rm cap})$ corrections. The **matched coupling** is
$$
\boxed{\ \alpha_{\mathrm{phys}}(\mu^*) = \frac{u^*}{4\pi\,\kappa_\*}\ }.
\tag{Z.6c}
$$
From $\mu^\*$, evolve to laboratory scales using the deterministic running (Appendix V):
$$
\frac{d\alpha}{d\ln\mu}=\frac{2}{3\pi}\!\left(\sum_{f}N_c^{f}Q_f^{2}\right)\alpha^2\ \ \text{(V.14)},\qquad
\alpha^{-1}(\mu_2)=\alpha^{-1}(\mu_1)-\frac{2}{3\pi}\!\left(\sum_{f}N_c^{f}Q_f^{2}\right)\ln\!\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}\ \ \text{(V.15)}.

## Z.7 Conclusion

The PU framework, through the synthesis of its core principles (PPI, PCE) and fundamental constants ($d_0$, $\varepsilon$), provides a complete, parameter-free derivation for the fine-structure constant at the MPU scale, yielding $1/\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(\mathrm{MPU}) \approx 138.843$. This prediction arises from the unique PCE-Attractor state, where the system's predictive machinery is maximally efficient and robust. The derivation fixes the underlying spectral parameters of the emergent U(1) interaction and provides a sharp, falsifiable identity for the system's core cost-benefit ratio. The result stands as a powerful demonstration of the framework's internal consistency and its potential to explain the values of fundamental constants from the logic and thermodynamics of prediction.
