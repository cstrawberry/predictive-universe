# Appendix S: Resource Cost, Stress–Energy, and the Gravitational Self-Limitation of CC

The PU framework predicts that any sustained context capable of biasing quantum outcome statistics (operational CC) carries a resource cost that manifests as stress–energy, producing a gravitational self-dephasing effect that limits its own efficacy. We make this quantitative.

#### **S.1 Step 1: Resource Cost of the Context State**

Let CC(S) denote the operational bias generated by system S. The framework's CC scaling law (Definition 32) is:
$$
\text{CC}(S) = \alpha_{CC,max} \frac{C_{agg} − C_{op}}{C_{scale} + (C_{agg} − C_{op})},
$$
Define the active context complexity above baseline as $C_{context} := C_{agg} − C_{op}$. Solving for $C_{context}$ in terms of CC yields:
$$
C_{context} = C_{scale} \frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha_{CC,max} − \text{CC}}.
$$
We adopt a quadratic operational cost function $R(C)$ around the baseline $C_{op}$, consistent with the convexity requirement of Definition 3a:
$$
R(C) = R(C_{op}) + r_p (C − C_{op})^2.
$$
The additional power required to maintain the context is:
$$
P_{context} = R(C_{op} + C_{context}) − R(C_{op}) = r_p C_{context}^2 = r_p C_{scale}^2 \left[\frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha_{CC,max} − \text{CC}}\right]^2.
$$
Defining the constant $A := r_p C_{scale}^2$ and setting $\alpha := \alpha_{CC,max}$, the power cost is:
$$
P_{context}(\text{CC}) = A \left[\frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha − \text{CC}}\right]^2.
$$

#### **S.2 Step 2: The CC-Context Stress–Energy Tensor $\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}$**

Assume the context state occupies a volume $V_S$ and behaves as a signal-rich fluid with an equation-of-state parameter $w_c \approx 1/3$, which is plausible for a medium dominated by driven, propagating internal signals that are relativistic in nature. The time-averaged energy density is
$$
u_{context}=\frac{P_{context}\,\tau_c}{V_S},\qquad p_{context}=w_c\,u_{context}.
$$
In the rest frame of system S, the perfect-fluid stress–energy tensor is
$$
\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}=\text{diag}\big(u_{context},\,p_{context},\,p_{context},\,p_{context}\big).
$$
For $w_c=1/3$,
$$
\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}=u_{context}\,\text{diag}(1,\,1/3,\,1/3,\,1/3).
$$

#### **S.3 Step 3: Gravitational Self-Disruption**

In the weak-field limit of General Relativity, the effective source for the Newtonian field is
$$
\rho_{source}=\frac{u_{context}+3\,p_{context}}{c^2}=(1+3w_c)\,\frac{u_{context}}{c^2}.
$$
For a uniform sphere of radius $R_S$, the radial gravitational field inside is
$$
g_{CC}(r)=\frac{4\pi G}{3}\,\rho_{source}\,r.
$$
A target of linear extent $L_q$ at radius $r$ experiences a potential difference
$$
\Delta\Phi_{diff}\approx g_{CC}(r)\,L_q,
$$
and over coherence time $\tau_c$ the resulting proper-time difference is
$$
\Delta\tau_d=\frac{\Delta\Phi_{diff}}{c^2}\,\tau_c
=K\,P_{context},
$$
with
$$
K:=\frac{4\pi G}{3c^4}\,(1+3w_c)\,\frac{r\,L_q}{V_S}\,\tau_c^{2}.
$$

#### **S.4 Step 4: PCE Optimization and the Self-Limiting CC***

This gravitational time dilation acts as a dephasing mechanism. The effective, achievable bias is reduced from the ideal value:
$$
\text{CC}_{eff} = \text{CC} \left(1 − \frac{\Delta\tau_d}{\tau_c}\right) = \text{CC} (1 − K P_{context}).
$$
The Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) drives the system to an equilibrium that maximizes a net-benefit functional, which balances the utility of the bias against its costs. We model this as:
$$
B_{net}(\text{CC}) = k_b \text{CC}_{eff} − k_c P_{context} = k_b \text{CC} − (k_b K \text{CC} + k_c) P_{context},
$$
with positive coefficients $k_b, k_c$ determined by the specific predictive task and system architecture.

For $\text{CC} \ll \alpha$, we can approximate $P_{context}(\text{CC}) \approx (A/\alpha^2) \text{CC}^2$. The stationarity condition $dB_{net}/d\text{CC} = 0$ becomes:
$$
\left(\frac{3A k_b K}{\alpha^2}\right) (\text{CC}^*)^2 + \left(\frac{2A k_c}{\alpha^2}\right) \text{CC}^* − k_b = 0.
$$
Solving the quadratic equation for the positive root gives the PCE-optimal bias, CC*. This demonstrates that any attempt to increase CC by raising the power $P_{context}$ ultimately triggers self-gravity–induced dephasing that reduces the effective bias, CC$_{eff}$. The PCE optimum balances the benefit of the bias against both its direct resource cost and its indirect gravitational self-sabotage.
