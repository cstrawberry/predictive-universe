# Appendix S: Resource Cost, Stress–Energy, and the Gravitational Self-Limitation of CC

The PU framework predicts that any sustained context capable of biasing quantum outcome statistics (operational CC) carries a resource cost that manifests as stress–energy, producing a gravitational self-dephasing effect that limits its own efficacy. We make this quantitative.

#### **S.1 Step 1: Resource Cost of the Context State**

Let CC(S) denote the operational bias generated by system S. The framework's CC scaling law (Definition 32) is:
$$
\text{CC}(S) = \alpha_{CC,max} \frac{C_{agg} − C_{op}}{C_{scale} + (C_{agg} − C_{op})}.
$$
Define the active context complexity above baseline as $C_{context} := C_{agg} − C_{op}$. Solving for $C_{context}$ in terms of CC yields:
$$
C_{context} = C_{scale} \frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha_{CC,max} − \text{CC}}.
$$
We adopt a quadratic operational cost function $R(C)$ expanded around the baseline $C_{op}$. Assuming the system is operating at a local minimum where the linear term $R'(C_{op})$ is negligible or absorbed into the baseline cost, the leading order expansion consistent with the convexity requirement (Definition 3a) is:
$$
R(C) \approx R(C_{op}) + r_p (C − C_{op})^2, \quad \text{where } r_p = \tfrac{1}{2}R''(C_{op}) > 0.
$$
The additional power required to maintain the context is:
$$
P_{context} = R(C_{op} + C_{context}) − R(C_{op}) = r_p C_{context}^2 = r_p C_{scale}^2 \left[\frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha_{CC,max} − \text{CC}}\right]^2.
$$
Defining the constant $A := r_p C_{scale}^2$ (which has dimensions of power) and setting $\alpha := \alpha_{CC,max}$ for brevity, the power cost is:
$$
P_{context}(\text{CC}) = A \left[\frac{\text{CC}}{\alpha − \text{CC}}\right]^2.
$$

#### **S.2 Step 2: The CC-Context Stress–Energy Tensor $\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}$**

Assume the context state occupies a volume $V_S$. We model its effective stress-energy contribution as a fluid. Given that the internal signaling required for maintaining predictive coherence is likely relativistic (propagating at or near $c$), an equation-of-state parameter $w_c \approx 1/3$ (characteristic of a relativistic gas or radiation) is physically plausible. The energy density, time-averaged over the context coherence timescale $\tau_c$, is
$$
u_{context}=\frac{P_{context}\,\tau_c}{V_S},\qquad p_{context}=w_c\,u_{context}.
$$
In the rest frame of system S, the perfect-fluid stress–energy tensor is
$$
\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}=\text{diag}\big(u_{context},\,p_{context},\,p_{context},\,p_{context}\big).
$$
For the relativistic fluid case $w_c=1/3$:
$$
\Delta T_{\mu\nu}^{(CC)}=u_{context}\,\text{diag}(1,\,1/3,\,1/3,\,1/3).
$$

*Result (Self‑limiting CC bound under a resource ceiling).* If an operational ceiling $u_{\rm context}\le u_{\max}$ holds, then using $P_{\rm context}\ge \Gamma_0 C_{\rm context}/\tau_c$ we have $u_{\rm context}\ge \Gamma_0 C_{\rm context}/V_S$ and hence
$$
\boxed{\ \mathrm{CC}\ \le\ \alpha_{CC,\max}\,\frac{u_{\max}}{u_{\max}+\kappa_*\,C_{\rm scale}}\ },\qquad \kappa_*:=\Gamma_0/V_S.
$$
Higher available energy density raises the cap, while causal‑consistency still enforces $\mathrm{CC}<\alpha_{CC,\max}$.

**Theorem S.C1 (Local CC biases cannot signal superluminally; gravitational bound).**
Let a bipartite system $AB$ be prepared in state $\rho_{AB}$. Let the local CC device on $A$ be described by a one-parameter family of completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps $\{\Phi_A^{(\epsilon)}\}_{\epsilon}$ with $\|\Phi_A^{(\epsilon)}-\mathcal E_A\|_{1\to 1}\le \alpha<1/2$, where $\mathcal{E}_A$ is the baseline (zero-CC) channel. Let this map act before a product measurement $\{E_i\otimes F_j\}$. Then the marginal on $B$ is unchanged for all $\epsilon$:

$$
\sum_i \operatorname{tr}\!\Big[(\Phi_A^{(\epsilon)}\otimes\mathrm{id}_B)(\rho_{AB})\, (E_i\otimes F_j)\Big]
=\operatorname{tr}\!\big[\rho_B F_j\big].
$$

Moreover, if the context stress–energy $\Delta T^{(CC)}_{\mu\nu}$ is perfect‑fluid as in S.2, the bias obeys the self‑limitation bound

$$
|\Delta P|\ \le\ \min\!\Big\{\alpha,\ c_1\,\frac{G\,u_{\mathrm{context}}\,L^2}{c^4}\Big\},
$$

where $L$ is the characteristic spatial scale (e.g., $L\sim c\,\tau_c$), and $c_1$ is a geometric factor.

*Proof.* CP‑TP local maps commute with partial trace: $\operatorname{tr}_A ((\Phi_A^{(\epsilon)}\otimes \mathrm{id}_B)(\rho_{AB}))=\operatorname{tr}_A \rho_{AB}$. Thus $B$’s marginal is invariant. The bound is the S.1–S.2 energy budget translated into probabilities via first‑order perturbation theory; positivity and the norm bound on the channel difference cap the operational effect. The completely bounded (cb) norm or diamond norm could also be used here, but the induced trace norm $\|\cdot\|_{1\to 1}$ is sufficient for this argument. ∎


#### **S.3 Step 3: Gravitational Self-Disruption**

In the weak-field limit of General Relativity, the effective source for the Newtonian field is
$$
\rho_{source}=\frac{u_{context}+3\,p_{context}}{c^2}=(1+3w_c)\,\frac{u_{context}}{c^2}.
$$
For a uniform sphere of radius $R_S$, the radial gravitational field inside is
$$
g_{CC}(r)=\frac{4\pi G}{3}\,\rho_{source}\,r.
$$
A target of linear extent $L_q$ at radius $r$ experiences a potential difference
$$
\Delta\Phi_{diff}\approx g_{CC}(r)\,L_q,
$$
and over coherence time $\tau_c$ the resulting proper-time difference is
$$
\Delta\tau_d=\frac{\Delta\Phi_{diff}}{c^2}\,\tau_c
=K\,P_{context},
$$
with
$$
K:=\frac{4\pi G}{3c^4}\,(1+3w_c)\,\frac{r\,L_q}{V_S}\,\tau_c^{2},\qquad K_{\mathrm{eff}}:=\frac{K}{\tau_c}.
$$

#### **S.4 Step 4: PCE Optimization and the Self-Limiting CC***

This gravitational time dilation acts as a dephasing mechanism. The effective, achievable bias is reduced from the ideal value:
$$
\text{CC}_{eff} = \text{CC} \left(1 − \frac{\Delta\tau_d}{\tau_c}\right) = \text{CC} \left(1 − K_{\mathrm{eff}}\, P_{context}\right).
$$
The Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) drives the system to an equilibrium that maximizes a net-benefit functional, which balances the utility of the bias against its costs. We model this as:
$$
B_{net}(\text{CC}) = k_b \text{CC}_{eff} − k_c P_{context} = k_b \text{CC} − \left(k_b K_{\mathrm{eff}} \text{CC} + k_c\right) P_{context},
$$
with positive coefficients $k_b, k_c$ determined by the specific predictive task and system architecture.

For $\text{CC} \ll \alpha$, we can approximate $P_{context}(\text{CC}) \approx (A/\alpha^2) \text{CC}^2$. The stationarity condition $dB_{net}/d\text{CC} = 0$ becomes:
$$
\left(\frac{3A k_b K_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\alpha^2}\right) (\text{CC}^*)^2 + \left(\frac{2A k_c}{\alpha^2}\right) \text{CC}^* − k_b = 0.
$$
Solving the quadratic equation for the positive root gives the PCE-optimal bias, CC*. This demonstrates that any attempt to increase CC by raising the power $P_{context}$ ultimately triggers self-gravity–induced dephasing that reduces the effective bias, CC$_{eff}$. The PCE optimum balances the benefit of the bias against both its direct resource cost and its indirect gravitational self-sabotage.
