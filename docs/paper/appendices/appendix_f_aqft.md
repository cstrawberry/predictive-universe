# Appendix F: AQFT Framework for Continuum Emergence and Locality

This appendix outlines the mathematical framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) in curved spacetimes [Haag 1996; Brunetti et al. 2015], providing the rigorous setting necessary to formalize the emergence of continuum physics from the discrete MPU network and to precisely analyze the status of locality and causality within the Predictive Universe (PU) framework. This approach focuses on the algebras of local observables and their relationships, offering a robust way to handle the continuum limit and define concepts like the stress-energy tensor and microcausality. The emergence described here is conditional on Theorem 43 (Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity).

**F.1 Net of Local Observables ($\mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})$)**

We associate algebraic structures to regions of the discrete MPU network sequence $(\mathcal{N}_n, d_{\mathcal{N}_n})$ that converges geometrically to the emergent spacetime manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$.

*   **Definition F.1 (Spacetime Regions and Discrete Correspondences):** Let $\mathfrak{O}(M)$ be the set of suitable causally complete, bounded, open regions in the emergent D=4 globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$. For $\mathcal{O} \in \mathfrak{O}(M)$, let $R_n(\mathcal{O}) \subset \mathcal{V}_n$ denote the subset of MPU vertices whose emergent location in the continuum limit lies within $\mathcal{O}$, such that $R_n(\mathcal{O})$ fills $\mathcal{O}$ in the limit $n\to\infty$.

*   **Definition F.2 (Microscopic Local Algebras $\mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})$):** To each region $\mathcal{O} \in \mathfrak{O}(M)$, associate a local algebra $\mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})$ acting on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}(R_n(\mathcal{O})) = \bigotimes_{v \in R_n(\mathcal{O})} \mathcal{H}_v$, where $\mathcal{H}_v$ is the Hilbert space of MPU $v$ (Proposition 4).
    1.  **Fundamental Operators:** Let $\mathcal{B}_v$ be a chosen basis set of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}_v$ (e.g., projections related to the spectral decomposition of $\hat{H}_v, \hat{C}_v$, representation of basis states, unitaries corresponding to local transformations).
    2.  **Finite Subsets:** For any finite subset of vertices $F \subset R_n(\mathcal{O})$, the algebra $\mathfrak{A}_n(F)$ is the algebra generated by operators acting only on $\bigotimes_{v \in F} \mathcal{H}_v$. This could be taken as $\bigotimes_{v \in F} \text{Alg}(\mathcal{B}_v)$.
    3.  **Local C*-Algebra:** The local C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}_n^{C^*}(\mathcal{O})$ is the closure of the union of $\mathfrak{A}_n(F)$ for all finite subsets $F \subset R_n(\mathcal{O})$ under the operator norm: $\mathfrak{A}_n^{C^*}(\mathcal{O}) = \overline{\bigcup_{F \subset R_n(\mathcal{O}), |F|<\infty} \mathfrak{A}_n(F)}^{\|\cdot\|}$.
    4.  **Local von Neumann Algebra:** The local von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak{A}_n^{vN}(\mathcal{O})$ is the weak*-closure of $\mathfrak{A}_n^{C^*}(\mathcal{O})$ in a relevant representation of the full network algebra.

This construction defines a net of algebras $\mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})$ indexed by $n$ and regions $\mathcal{O}$, satisfying isotony: if $\mathcal{O}_1 \subset \mathcal{O}_2$, then $\mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O}_1) \subset \mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O}_2)$ (operators localized in $\mathcal{O}_1$ are also localized in $\mathcal{O}_2$).

**F.2 Emergence of Einstein Causality from ND-RID Limits**

Standard relativistic causality (microcausality) — namely that observables in space-like separated regions commute — follows directly from the finite effective light-cone enforced by ND-RID dynamics.


**Proposition F.1 (Discrete Lieb–Robinson Bound).**
Let $\mathcal{N}_n$ be an MPU network with local “Evolve” (Def. 27) and Internal Prediction (Def. 26) steps, giving rise to an effective Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}_n$.  For bounded operators

$$
A\in\mathfrak{A}_n(X),\quad B\in\mathfrak{A}_n(Y),
$$

supported on vertex sets $X,Y\subset\mathcal V_n$ at graph-distance
$\displaystyle d_{\mathcal N_n}(X,Y)=\min_{x\in X,y\in Y}d_{\mathcal N_n}(x,y)$,
there exist constants $C,\mu>0$ and a finite velocity $v_{LR}^{(n)}$ (controlled by the irreducible cost $\varepsilon>0$ and contractivity $f_{RID}<1$) such that

$$
\bigl\|\,[\alpha_t^{(n)}(A),B]\,\bigr\|
\;\le\;
C\,\|A\|\|B\|\,|X|\,
e^{-\mu\bigl(d_{\mathcal N_n}(X,Y)-v_{LR}^{(n)}\,t\bigr)}.
\tag{F.1}
$$

**Proof Sketch:** 
The proof relies on generalized Lieb-Robinson bounds applicable to open quantum systems governed by local Liouvillian dynamics. The evolution is given by $\alpha_t^{(n)} = e^{t\mathcal{L}_n}$. Standard techniques for proving such bounds on lattices with local interactions involve analyzing the propagation of operators under the action of the Liouvillian superoperator $\mathcal{L}_n$. The finite interaction range and the contractive nature of the underlying ND-RID process (which bounds the strength of the non-unitary part of the Liouvillian) ensure that the norm of the commutator decays exponentially outside a linear light-cone defined by a finite Lieb-Robinson velocity $v_{LR}^{(n)}$, yielding the form in (F.1). We justify the assumption $v_{LR}^{(n)}\to c$ in Corollary F.1 by identifying the emergent invariant speed $c$ (Theorem 46) as the macroscopic limit of the microscopic network's maximum information propagation velocity, which is precisely what $v_{LR}^{(n)}$ quantifies.

**Corollary F.1 (Emergence of Einstein Causality).**
If the sequence $\{\mathcal N_n\}$ converges geometrically to a Lorentzian spacetime $(M,g_{\mu\nu})$ with invariant speed $c$, and $v_{LR}^{(n)}\to c$ as $n\to\infty$, then for any two space-like separated regions $\mathcal O_1,\mathcal O_2\subset M$ one has

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}
\bigl\|[\alpha_t^{(n)}(A_n),B_n]\bigr\|
=0,
$$

for $A_n\in\mathfrak A_n(\mathcal O_1)$, $B_n\in\mathfrak A_n(\mathcal O_2)$.  Hence
$\,[\mathfrak A(\mathcal O_1),\,\mathfrak A(\mathcal O_2)] = \{0\}$,
recovering Einstein causality (Theorem 46).


**F.3 Continuum Limit and Emergent AQFT Net**

The transition from the discrete MPU network to continuum physics is formalized as the convergence of the sequence of discrete nets of algebras $\{\mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})\}$.

**Hypothesis F.1 (Convergence to Stable, Local AQFT).** The MPU network sequence $\{\mathcal{N}_n\}$, evolving under PCE dynamics (Appendix D) towards a stable, viable equilibrium configuration, is hypothesized to converge robustly in the limit $n \to \infty$ to a structure satisfying the following conditions. This hypothesis represents a strong assumption about the behavior of the MPU network in the continuum limit:
1.  **Geometric Convergence:** The network metric spaces $(\mathcal{V}_n, d_{\mathcal{N}_n})$ converge to a D=4 Lorentzian manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$ (realizing Theorem 43 and Theorem 46).
2.  **Algebraic Convergence:** The sequence of discrete nets of algebras $\mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathfrak{A}_n(\mathcal{O})$ converges in a suitable sense (e.g., Stone-von Neumann theorem for finite regions, or more general convergence for nets) to a limiting continuous net $\mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O})$ defined on $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$.
3.  **Emergent AQFT Axioms:** The limit net $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies the standard Haag-Kastler axioms of AQFT (isotony, locality/causality, covariance under the emergent isometry group, time slice axiom), adapted for curved spacetime.
4.  **Emergent Einstein Causality:** The limit net $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies the crucial Einstein Causality axiom ($[\mathfrak A(\mathcal O_1),\,\mathfrak A(\mathcal O_2)] = \{0\}$ for spacelike separated $\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2$), as derived in Corollary F.1.

**Definition F.3 (Emergent AQFT Net and Properties).** Conditional on Hypothesis F.1, the emergent continuum physics is described by a net of local C*-algebras $\mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O})$ satisfying the Haag-Kastler axioms on the manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$. This net embodies the locality structure derived from the underlying MPU dynamics.

**F.4 Physical States and Dynamics**

*   **Emergent Physical States:** Physical states in the continuum AQFT are described by states on the algebra $\mathfrak{A} = \overline{\bigcup_{\mathcal{O}} \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O})}$, which are positive, normalized linear functionals $\omega: \mathfrak{A} \to \mathbb{C}$. The physical state $\omega$ on $\mathfrak{A}$ arises as a limit of the stable configurations of the MPU network, capturing expectation values $\langle A \rangle_\omega = \omega(A)$ for operators $A \in \mathfrak{A}$. The specific properties of physical states (e.g., vacuum state, thermal states) are determined by the dynamics and the optimization principles (POP/PCE).

*   **Emergent Dynamics Generator:** The dynamics of the emergent quantum fields are generated by an effective evolution, arising as a limit of the coarse-grained MPU Dual Dynamics. In the Heisenberg picture, time evolution $\alpha_t$ on the algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ is generated by a Liouvillian superoperator $\mathcal{L}^*$: $\partial_t A = \mathcal{L}^*(A)$. This $\mathcal{L}^*$ contains:
    *   **Hamiltonian part:** Generated by an effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ (emergent from the limit of $\sum \hat{H}_v + \sum \hat{V}_{pot}^{(vv')}$). This part corresponds to unitary evolution $-i[H_{eff}, \cdot]$, describing coherent dynamics.
    *   **Dissipative part:** Generated by the coarse-grained average of the irreversible 'Evolve' process (ND-RID, linked to $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$, Theorem 31). This non-unitary part is described by Lindblad terms and ensures consistency with emergent thermodynamics (Appendix E).

**F.5 Rigorous Definition of $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$**

AQFT allows for a rigorous, state-dependent definition of the macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ as an operator-valued distribution, capturing the energy and momentum content of the emergent fields derived from the MPU network activity.

*   **Definition F.4 (Macroscopic $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ in AQFT):** Within the emergent AQFT framework (conditional on Definition F.3), the macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}(x)$ is defined rigorously in two consistent ways:
    1.  **As Expectation Value:** As the expectation value of a symmetric, operator-valued distribution $\hat{\Theta}_{\mu\nu}(x)$ affiliated with the algebra $\mathfrak{A}$, representing the continuum limit of the microscopic symmetric tensor operator operator $\hat{\Theta}_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}(v)$ (defined in Definition B.7 based on Theorem B.4 in Appendix B). This requires a process of regularization and renormalization in the continuum limit. $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}(x) = \omega(\hat{\Theta}_{\mu\nu}(x))$, where $\omega$ is the physical state (Section F.4). This definition connects the macroscopic tensor to the underlying MPU activity and costs.
    2.  **Via Variation of Effective Action:** Assuming the emergent dynamics can be effectively described by a generally covariant effective action $S_{eff}[\omega, g]$ for the matter fields in a given state $\omega$ coupled to gravity $g_{\mu\nu}$, the stress-energy tensor can be variationally defined as:
        $$
        T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}(x) := \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g(x)}} \frac{\delta S_{eff}[\omega, g]}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}(x)} \quad \tag{F.3}
        $$
    Consistency of the framework requires these two definitions to agree for physical states $\omega$ satisfying the emergent dynamical equations (on-shell states).

*   **Theorem F.1 (Covariant Conservation of $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ in AQFT).** Assuming the effective action $S_{eff}[\omega, g]$ is generally covariant (invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$), the variationally defined stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}(x)$ (Equation F.3) is covariantly conserved ($\nabla^{\mu} T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})} = 0$) when the emergent dynamical equations for the state $\omega$ (derived from $\delta S_{eff} / \delta \omega = 0$) and the geometry $g_{\mu\nu}$ (if it is also dynamical) are satisfied (on-shell).

*Proof:* This is a standard result from classical and quantum field theory in curved spacetime, following from Noether's second theorem applied to the diffeomorphism invariance of the action functional. If the action is invariant under a symmetry, the variation of the action with respect to the symmetry parameter leads to a conserved current or tensor. For diffeomorphism invariance, this conserved quantity is the stress-energy tensor, and its conservation is expressed as covariant divergence being zero on-shell.

**F.6 Rigorous Formulation of Locality and Statistical FTL**

AQFT provides the precise language to formulate PU's stance on locality, distinguishing between operator-level locality and state-mediated influence.

1.  **Emergent Einstein Causality for Algebra $\mathfrak{A}$:** As derived in Corollary F.1, the emergent net $\mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O})$ satisfies the standard AQFT axiom of Einstein Causality: $[\mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O}_1), \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O}_2)] = \{0\}$ for space-like separated regions $\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2$. This implies that local measurements or operations performed in $\mathcal{O}_1$ cannot causally influence local measurements or operations performed in $\mathcal{O}_2$ in a way that violates the commutation relation for local observables.

2.  **CC Influence Mediated by Global State $\omega$:** The CC mechanism (Hypothesis 3) acts on a pre-existing, globally defined state $\omega$ of the MPU network, which may possess non-local correlations like entanglement (Proposition 10). The influence is a *local* process: a high-CC system $S_A$ in region $\mathcal{O}_A$, via its internal context $C_A$, locally biases the parameters of the 'Evolve' process for interactions occurring within $\mathcal{O}_A$. This bias acts upon the outcomes determined by Logical Indeterminacy (Definition 12). While SPAP (Theorems 10, 11) proves that outcomes are fundamentally unpredictable (logically indeterminate), the CC mechanism proposes that the *probability distribution* over these indeterminate outcomes is not fixed but can be subtly modulated by emergent complexity. The mechanism leverages the inherent context-sensitivity of the ND-RID parameters (Assumption 1) to favor specific outcomes within the logically allowed possibilities. This does not change the global state $\omega$ instantaneously. Instead, the statistical FTL effect (Postulate 3) arises because the outcomes of these locally biased 'Evolve' events in $\mathcal{O}_A$ are correlated, through the entanglement present in the state $\omega$, with the outcomes of 'Evolve' events in a space-like separated region $\mathcal{O}_B$. The influence is mediated by the pre-existing correlations in the state, not by a superluminal change of the state itself.

3.  **State-Mediated Statistical Influence (Postulate 3 Formalized):** Consider Bob performing a measurement associated with operator $B \in \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O}_B)$ in a region $\mathcal{O}_B$ space-like separated from $\mathcal{O}_A$. The expectation value of $B$ in the state $\omega_{C_A}$ is $\langle B \rangle = \omega_{C_A}(B)$. Postulate 3, the hypothesis of statistical FTL influence, asserts that different contexts $C_{A,1}, C_{A,2}$ generated by Alice's system in $\mathcal{O}_A$ can lead to distinct global states $\omega_{C_{A,1}}, \omega_{C_{A,2}}$ such that Bob's local measurement statistics (e.g., expectation values, probabilities of outcomes calculated from the state) differ:
    $$
    \omega_{C_{A,1}}(B) \neq \omega_{C_{A,2}}(B) \quad \text{(Statistical FTL Correlation)} \quad \tag{F.4}
    $$
    This dependence of local statistics on a distant context is a manifestation of correlations encoded in the global state $\omega$. Crucially, this does *not* violate operator locality (Corollary F.1), as the operators themselves still commute. The influence is mediated by the *state* $\omega$, not by superluminal propagation of effects through local operations.

4.  **Compatibility with Operational Causality:** The compatibility between emergent operator locality (Corollary F.1) and the potential state-mediated influence (Equation F.4) is maintained mathematically within AQFT. Consistency with operational causality (Postulate 2 - no deterministic FTL signaling) is ensured by the constraints derived within the PU framework:
    *   CC Bound: $\text{CC} \le \alpha_{CC,max} < 0.5$ (Theorem 39) prevents Alice from deterministically *forcing* Bob's outcome for any initial state, irrespective of entanglement.
    *   ND-RID Information Limits: The underlying irreversible ND-RID interactions mediating state changes and correlations are subject to irreducible costs ($\varepsilon > 0$, Theorem 31), strict contractivity ($f_{RID} < 1$, Lemma E.1), and finite channel capacity ($C_{max} < \ln d_0$, Theorem E.2). As analyzed in Section 10 (Theorem 40, Theorem 41) and implied by the properties of channels in AQFT (Section F.2, Prop F.1), these limits fundamentally restrict the rate and fidelity of any potential information transfer via this mechanism, preventing the construction of deterministic signaling protocols required for causal paradoxes (Theorem 42).

AQFT formalizes how emergent operator locality for observables coexists with constrained state-mediated statistical non-locality for expectations and outcome probabilities. The influence is in the preparation of the global state ensemble, not in the local interaction rule.

**F.7 Maintaining Lorentz Invariance**

The framework is argued to maintain Lorentz invariance despite the hypothesis of state-mediated statistical FTL influence (Postulate 3):
1.  **State Dependence:** The statistical influence (Equation F.4) depends on the global state $\omega_{C_A}$. Lorentz transformations act consistently on both the operators $B \in \mathfrak{A}(\mathcal{O}_B)$ and the description of the state $\omega$.
2.  **No Preferred Frame Signaling:** The impossibility of *deterministic* signaling (Theorem 42) means the statistical influence cannot be used to synchronize clocks or establish a preferred reference frame for information transmission. The influence is purely statistical and does not constitute operational communication capable of violating Lorentz invariance.
3.  **Lorentz Covariance of Dynamics:** The underlying effective action $S_{eff}$ (Section F.5) and dynamics generator $\mathcal{L}^*$ (Section F.4) are assumed to be Lorentz or generally covariant in the emergent spacetime. The process of state preparation $\omega_{C_A}$ and the resulting statistical correlations transform consistently under Lorentz boosts.
4.  **Analogy with Entanglement:** This is analogous to the non-locality of standard quantum entanglement, which is compatible with Lorentz invariance because it cannot be used for deterministic superluminal signaling (the outcome of a local measurement is fundamentally random, even if correlated with a distant outcome). The CC state-mediated influence is argued to fall into this category.

**F.8 Conclusion: AQFT as Arena for Verification and Locality**

AQFT provides a robust mathematical framework for analyzing the properties of the hypothesized continuum limit of the MPU network. The analysis presented here is strictly conditional on the validity of Hypothesis F.1 (the convergence to a stable AQFT) and Theorem 43 (geometric regularity). Subject to these assumptions, AQFT allows for:
*   Precise definition of emergent physical states and dynamics.
*   Rigorous definition of the macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ (Definition F.4).
*   Demonstration that the emergent algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies standard Einstein Causality (Microcausality, as stated in Corollary F.1) as a consequence of the underlying ND-RID properties (Corollary F.1).
*   A clear formulation of the framework's stance on locality, allowing for a hypothesized state-mediated statistical FTL influence (Equation F.4, Postulate 3) that is compatible with emergent operator locality (as stated in Corollary F.1) as analyzed in Section F.6.
*   Confirmation that consistency with operational causality (Postulate 2) is maintained via the CC bound (Theorem 39) and the information limitations of the underlying ND-RID interactions (Theorem 40, Theorem 41, as analyzed in Section F.6), preventing deterministic signaling (Theorem 42).

Establishing the full convergence from discrete MPU dynamics to a stable, local AQFT satisfying the Haag-Kastler axioms (Hypothesis F.1), rigorously deriving the emergent dynamics generator $\mathcal{L}^*$, and definitively proving the impossibility of deterministic signaling within this formal setting are key future theoretical tasks for validating the PU framework's consistency and its unique stance on locality.
