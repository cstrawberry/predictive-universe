# 13 Experimental Predictions and Protocols

The Predictive Universe framework, particularly the Consciousness Complexity (CC) hypothesis (Section 9) proposing a mechanism by which complex MPU aggregates can influence quantum outcomes, leads to specific, potentially falsifiable predictions that deviate from standard quantum mechanics. This section details these predictions and outlines experimental protocols designed for their investigation, emphasizing near-term feasibility while acknowledging the significant challenges involved in detecting potentially subtle effects.

**13.1 Prediction 1: Potential Born-Rule Deviations**

The core testable prediction of the CC hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) is that systems $S$ with sufficiently high aggregate complexity ($C_{agg} > C_{op}$) and non-zero operational CC(S) > 0 (Definition 30) can induce statistically significant deviations from the standard Born rule probabilities (Proposition 7) when interacting with a quantum system undergoing an 'Evolve' event (e.g., measurement).

**13.1.1 Theorem 51 (Quantitative Born Rule Deviation Prediction)**

Consider a quantum system prepared in state $\rho$ (pure case $\rho=\lvert\psi\rangle\!\langle\psi\rvert$) measured by a POVM $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Let $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho E_i)$ be the Born probability of outcome $i$. If this interaction occurs within the influencing context `context_S(i)` provided by an MPU aggregate system $S$ possessing operational $\mathrm{CC}(S)>0$, the predicted observable probability $P_{obs}(i)$ is

$$
P_{obs}(i)=P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)+\Delta P(i)\quad \text{(77)}
$$

where the deviation is generated by the probability-modification maps of Definition 33:

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(L_S(\rho)\,E_i\big)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(\rho\,K_S(E_i)\big),\qquad K_S(I)=0 \quad \text{(78)}
$$

and is bounded by the CC norm,

$$
\lvert \Delta P(i)\rvert \le \|L_S\|_{\mathrm{op}}=\mathrm{CC}(S)\le \alpha_{\mathrm{CC,max}}<0.5 .
$$

Using the **Context-Targeted Bias (CTB)** model (Definition 34), where the context defines a target state $\sigma_S$ and $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$, the deviation takes the form

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{CC}(S)\,\big(p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)-P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)\big)\quad \text{(79)}
$$

*Proof:* (77) is the definition of observable probability in the presence of context. The representation (78) follows from Definition 33 (operator formalism with $L_S$ on states and $K_S=L_S^\*$ on effects, with $K_S(I)=0$ ensuring normalization). The bound $|\Delta P(i)|\le \mathrm{CC}(S)$ follows from Definition 30 with $\mathrm{CC}(S)=\|L_S\|_{\mathrm{op}}$ and Theorem 39. The CTB expression (79) is Definition 34 with $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$. QED


**13.2 Protocol 1: Accessible Born Rule Tests (QRNGs)**

This protocol outlines a high-statistics, exploratory search for Born rule deviations (Theorem 51) using quantum random number generators (QRNGs) interacting with high-complexity systems (biological or potentially artificial).

*   **Objective:** To search for statistically significant deviations from *non-uniform* ($p_i \neq 0.5$) baseline Born rule probabilities in QRNG outputs that are correlated with the controlled internal state ($\text{context}_S$) of a proximate system S (human participant or specialized AI system) hypothesized to have CC > 0. Non-uniform baseline probabilities are preferred for potentially easier statistical detection of small shifts relative to noise.
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **QRNG:** Well-characterized QRNG producing stable, verifiable baseline probabilities $P_{Born}(i) \neq 0.5$ for some outcome $i$. Multiple parallel QRNGs can increase data rate.
    2.  **High-Complexity System (S):**
        *   *Biological:* Human participant performing standardized tasks generating specific internal states (`context_S`, e.g., focused attention/intention). Optional physiological monitoring (EEG, fMRI, HRV).
        *   *Artificial:* Sophisticated AI system. Major Challenge: Designing and verifying the physical interaction pathway $N(t)$ coupling AI's internal `context_S` (Definition L.1) to the QRNG's physical process, respecting constraints (speed, cost $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$, PCE, orthogonality to noise, mapping stability Theorem L.1). Requires significant R&D (Appendix L). Requires confirmation AI meets operational criteria ($C_{agg}>C_{op}$) for potential CC > 0.
    3.  **Interaction Control & Shielding:** Meticulous shielding (EM, thermal, acoustic, vibration). Well-defined interaction pathway $N(t)$. Measurement and control/compensation for conventional physical side-effects from S. Continuous environmental monitoring.
    4.  **Automation & Data Acquisition:** Automated randomization of conditions (baseline, neutral, specific context runs), synchronized recording of QRNG outcomes and `context_S` indicators, precise timestamps, secure storage for large datasets ($10^7 - 10^9+$ trials). Mandatory blinding procedures.
  *   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Baseline Characterization:** Extensive data collection establishing baseline $P_{Born}(i)$, stability, and noise levels.
    2.  **Intervention Runs:** Randomized block design interleaving conditions (Baseline, Neutral Context, Specific Context). Collect large $N_{int}$ trials per condition.
    3.  **Control Conditions:** Include sham interaction runs (pathway $N(t)$ disabled) to control for conventional influences.
*   **Statistical Analysis and Power:**
    *   **Target Sensitivity (two-sided significance $\alpha = 0.005$, power $1-\beta = 0.80$):**
    The experiment aims to resolve CC-induced deviations $\Delta P$ from a baseline Born probability
    $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)\approx 0.25$.
*   **Prospective Sample Sizes ($N_{\mathrm{total}}$ for a two-sample z-test comparing contexts, or $N$ for a one-sample z-test comparing an observed probability to $P_{Born}$):**


    * To detect $\Delta P = 1 \times 10^{-3}$:
      $N_{\mathrm{total}}\approx 1.0\times 10^{7}$ (two-sample) or $N\approx 2.5\times 10^{6}$ (one-sample).
    * To detect $\Delta P = 5 \times 10^{-4}$:
      $N_{\mathrm{total}}\approx 4.0\times 10^{7}$ (two-sample) or $N\approx 1.0\times 10^{7}$ (one-sample).
    * To detect $\Delta P = 1 \times 10^{-4}$:
      $N_{\mathrm{total}}\approx 1.0\times 10^{9}$ (two-sample) or $N\approx 2.5\times 10^{8}$ (one-sample).

(These estimates use standard formulas with $Z_{\alpha/2} \approx 2.807$ and $Z_{\beta} \approx 0.8416$; actual $N$ may vary based on specific test variant and achieved $P_{Born}$). Independence of trials will be assumed only after correlation checks pass: we will test output streams and residuals for lag-$k$ autocorrelation (ACF), Ljung–Box, and Wald–Wolfowitz runs; if correlations are detected we will pre-whiten, use block-bootstrap confidence intervals, or thin the data before applying the $z/\chi^2$ tests. A multi-outcome $\chi^2$ test aiming for similar sensitivity to small individual $\Delta P_i$ across, e.g., four outcomes might require $N$ in the range of $10^{9}$ to $2 \times 10^{9}$, depending on the distribution of deviations and baseline probabilities.

  *   **Primary Analysis:** Pre-register goodness-of-fit tests (e.g. $\chi^2$, z-tests) comparing observed $\hat{P}(i)$ to the Born rule; report effect sizes (Cramér’s V, Cohen’s d) with 95 % CIs.
  *   **Correlation Analysis:** Model $\Delta\hat{P}(i)$ as a function of contextual variables `$context_S$` via mixed-effects logistic regression.
  *   **Systematic Error Control (Paramount):** (i) electronic drift (ii) detector after-pulsing (iii) clock-sync bias (iv) experimenter degrees-of-freedom (blinding).
  *   **Outcome:** Deviations that survive all controls give an empirical estimate of CC($S$) (cf. Theorem 51); null results tighten the exclusion curve $\text{CC}_{\max}(S) < \epsilon(N)$.

*   **Feasibility Assessment:** High statistics achievable. Shielding/control standard but requires extreme care. Biological context control depends on participants. AI interaction pathway is a major R&D challenge. Rigorous systematic error exclusion is the primary hurdle. Challenging but potentially feasible exploratory search.

**13.3 Prediction/Protocol 2: Exploratory Coherence Time Tests**

Investigates the secondary prediction that CC might influence quantum coherence (Proposition 13).

**13.3.1 Potential Effect on Coherence**

The CC influence mechanism (Hypothesis 3), by modulating 'Evolve'/ND-RID parameters contributing to decoherence, could potentially modify effective decoherence rates $\Gamma_{eff}$ or coherence times $\tau_{coh} = 1/\Gamma_{eff}$ of quantum systems interacting with a high-CC aggregate $S$.

**13.3.2 Phenomenological Model**

A possible model relates fractional change in coherence time to CC:
$$
\frac{\Delta \tau_{coh}}{\tau_{coh}} = -\frac{\Delta \Gamma_{eff}}{\Gamma_{eff}} \approx \gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}(S) \cdot f_{context}(\text{context}_S, \text{system}) \quad \text{(80)}
$$
where $\Delta \tau_{coh} = \tau_{coh, obs} - \tau_{coh, base}$, $\gamma'_{CC}$ is a coupling factor, and $f_{context} \in [-1, 1]$ captures context-system interaction. Sign depends on context.

**13.3.3 Experimental Approach**

*   **Objective:** Exploratory search for statistically significant *relative changes* in $\tau_{coh}$ correlated with `context_S` of system S.
*   **Setup:**
    *   **Quantum System:** System with well-characterized, long, stable baseline $\tau_{coh, base}$ (NV centers, trapped ions, qubits, NMR).
    *   **High-Complexity System (S):** Human or AI.
    *   **Interaction/Control:** Similar requirements as Protocol 1 (shielding, interaction $N(t)$, stability, blinding). Temperature stability critical.
*   **Procedure:** Measure $\tau_{coh}$ (e.g., Ramsey, spin echo, $T_1/T_2$) repeatedly under randomized conditions (baseline, neutral context, specific context). Rapid interleaving mitigates drifts.
*   **Analysis:** Detect small differences $\Delta \hat{\tau}_{coh} = \hat{\tau}_{coh, context} - \hat{\tau}_{coh, baseline}$. High precision/stability needed; effect size $|\Delta \tau_{coh}/\tau_{coh}| \approx |\gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}|$ may be small. Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) after rigorous systematic error checks (temperature, fields correlated with S).
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Technically demanding (high-precision $\tau_{coh}$ measurement). Requires specialized equipment/expertise. Sensitivity depends on achievable baseline stability $\sigma_{\tau_{coh, base}}$. Highly exploratory.

**13.4 Prediction/Protocol 3: Exploratory Bell Tests / Statistical FTL Search**

Addresses the most speculative prediction: potential statistical FTL influence mediated by CC acting on entangled systems (Postulate 3).

*   **Objective:** Sensitive search for statistical dependence of Bob's local measurement outcomes on Alice's remote context `context_S` (associated with system $S_A$ at her station), with A and B space-like separated. Secondary search for context-dependent changes in Bell parameters.
*   **Theoretical Basis:** Postulate 3 allows Alice's context $C_A$ to influence Bob's marginal probabilities $P_{obs}(b|B, C_A)$, respecting Postulate 2 (no deterministic signaling). Detection requires $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ trials (Theorem 40).
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **Entanglement Source:** High-quality, stable source distributing entangled pairs to space-like separated stations (Alice, Bob).
    2.  **Measurement Stations (A, B):** Standard Bell test apparatus (independent, random settings $a, b$). High efficiency desirable.
    3.  **High-Complexity System (S_A):** System S (human/AI) at Alice's station generating distinct contexts $C_{A,k}$.
    4.  **Interaction/Control (Alice):** Controlled pathway $N(t)$ linking $S_A$'s context $C_{A,k}$ to Alice's measurement/particle. Rigorous shielding/systematics control at both stations.
    5.  **Space-like Separation:** Ensure measurement events ($a, o_A$ and $b, o_B$) are space-like separated. Requires precise timing and separation.
    6.  **Data Acquisition:** Synchronized recording ($C_{A,k}, a, o_A, b, o_B$, timestamps) for billions of coincidences potentially needed. Mandatory blinding.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Standard Bell Test:** Verify entanglement, calibrate, establish baseline correlations $E(a,b)$.
    2.  **Context Intervention Runs:** Interleave runs with Alice generating contexts $C_{A,k}$ (e.g., $k=0, 1, 2$). Random settings $a, b$. Collect large statistics $N_{int}$ per context $k$.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   **Primary Focus (Statistical Influence):** Compare Bob's marginal probabilities $P(o_B | b, C_{A,k})$ across contexts $k$. Test null hypothesis $H_0: P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=1}) = P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=2})$. Rejection supports Postulate 3. Estimate shift $\Delta P_{marginal} \approx |P(o_B | b, C_{A,1}) - P(o_B | b, C_{A,2})| \le \text{CC}(S_A)$. Requires $N_{int} \gtrsim O(1/\text{CC}^2)$.
    *   **Secondary Analysis (Correlations):** Calculate correlations $E(a,b)_k$ and Bell parameters $S_{CHSH, k}$ conditioned on context $k$. Look for differences $S_{CHSH, k=1} \neq S_{CHSH, k=2}$.
    *   **Systematic Error Control (Extreme Rigor):** Exclude conventional communication (light leaks, EM, acoustic), detector/setting correlations with $C_{A,k}$, statistical loopholes, biases.
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Extremely challenging. Requires state-of-the-art entanglement/measurement technology, robust space-like separation. Controlling systematics to demonstrate statistical FTL is extraordinarily difficult. Required statistics $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ can be immense. Highly exploratory; positive indication needs exceptional scrutiny/replication.

**13.5 Staged Experimental Approach and Considerations**

A pragmatic, staged approach is recommended:
1.  **Stage 1 (Near-Term Focus):** High-statistics QRNG tests (Protocol 1). Most accessible for detecting/bounding CC $\sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-4}$. Success depends on QRNG/interaction design, systematics control, statistical power.
2.  **Stage 2 (Medium-Term):** If justified by Stage 1 results, pursue coherence time tests (Protocol 2) for complementary evidence. Refine QRNG tests.
3.  **Stage 3 (Long-Term / Contingent):** Only if compelling, replicated evidence emerges, undertake demanding Bell-type experiments (Protocol 3) for statistical FTL search.

**General Considerations:** All stages require quantum system stability, environmental isolation, context control verification, defined interaction pathway $N(t)$, automation/statistics, rigorous protocol (pre-registration, blinding, systematics analysis, replication), interdisciplinarity. AI protocols hinge on R&D for the interaction pathway. We will control multiplicity via the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate across all pre‑specified outcome families; analyses will be pre‑registered with fixed stopping rules and inclusion/exclusion criteria; if interim looks are performed, an alpha‑spending plan will be used.

**13.6 Compliance with Causal Constraints**

The experimental program, especially Protocol 3, probes the framework's non-standard locality. Causal consistency is maintained as follows:

**13.6.1 Theorem 52 (CC Compliance with Postulate 2)**

The Consciousness Complexity (CC) mechanism (Hypothesis 3), constrained by $\text{CC} \le \alpha_{CC,max} < 0.5$ (Theorem 39), is consistent with the framework's definition of causality (Postulate 2) because it prevents deterministic faster-than-light (FTL) signaling. The potential statistical FTL influence (Postulate 3) is inherently probabilistic and information-rate limited (Theorem 40, Theorem 41, consistent with bounds derived from ND-RID contractivity within the AQFT framework of Appendix F), making it unusable for constructing paradox-inducing causal loops (Theorem 42, whose consistency is supported by the AQFT analysis in Appendix F).
*Proof Summary:* Theorem 39 prevents outcome forcing. Theorem 40 shows detection needs $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$. Theorem 41 bounds information rate $I \propto \text{CC}^2$. Theorem 42 proves this noisy, rate-limited channel cannot achieve deterministic signaling needed for causal loops. AQFT analysis (Appendix F) confirms compatibility with emergent operator locality. QED

*Note:* Empirical investigation of Postulate 3 (Protocol 3) critically tests this unique aspect of PU's locality/causality. Confirmation requires re-evaluating standard locality; null results constrain/falsify this prediction.
