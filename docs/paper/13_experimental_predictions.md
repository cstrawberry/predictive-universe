# 13 Experimental Predictions and Protocols

The Predictive Universe framework, particularly the Consciousness Complexity (CC) hypothesis (Section 9) proposing a mechanism by which complex MPU aggregates can influence quantum outcomes, leads to specific, potentially falsifiable predictions that deviate from standard quantum mechanics. This section details these predictions and outlines experimental protocols designed for their investigation, emphasizing near-term feasibility while acknowledging the significant challenges involved in detecting potentially subtle effects.

**13.1 Prediction 1: Potential Born-Rule Deviations**

The core testable prediction of the CC hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) is that systems $S$ with sufficiently high aggregate complexity ($C_{agg} > C_{op}$) and non-zero operational CC(S) > 0 (Definition 30) can induce statistically significant deviations from the standard Born rule probabilities (Proposition 7) when interacting with a quantum system undergoing an 'Evolve' event (e.g., measurement).

**13.1.1 Theorem 51 (Quantitative Born Rule Deviation Prediction)**

Consider a quantum system prepared in state $\rho$ (pure case $\rho=\lvert\psi\rangle\!\langle\psi\rvert$) measured by a POVM $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Let $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho E_i)$ be the Born probability of outcome $i$. If this interaction occurs within the influencing context `context_S(i)` provided by an MPU aggregate system $S$ possessing operational $\mathrm{CC}(S)>0$, the predicted observable probability $P_{obs}(i)$ is

$$
P_{obs}(i)=P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)+\Delta P(i)\quad \text{(77)}
$$

where the deviation is generated by the probability-modification maps of Definition 33:

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(L_S(\rho)\,E_i\big)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(\rho\,K_S(E_i)\big),\qquad K_S(I)=0 \quad \text{(78)}
$$

and the deviation magnitude is rigorously bounded by the information-geometric constraint derived from the PCE-minimal modification principle (Theorem 36):
$$
|\Delta P(i)| \le \mathrm{TV}(p,q) \le \sin\!\big(\mathrm{CC}(S)/2\big).
$$
In the small‑bias regime ($\mathrm{CC}(S)\ll 1$): $|\Delta P(i)| \lesssim \mathrm{CC}(S)/2$.
Therefore, for an observed per‑outcome shift $\delta=|\Delta P(i)|$, a conservative exact lower bound is
$\mathrm{CC}(S) \ge 2\,\arcsin(\delta)$ (small bias: $\mathrm{CC}(S) \gtrsim 2\delta$).

*Proof:* The bounds are derived directly from the PCE-minimal modification principle (Definition 33) applied to the geometry of the statistical manifold, as rigorously established in Theorem 36.


Using the **Context-Targeted Bias (CTB)** model (Definition 34), where the context defines a target state $\sigma_S$ and $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$, the deviation takes the form

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{CC}(S)\,\big(p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)-P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)\big)\quad \text{(79)}
$$

*Proof:* (77) is the definition of observable probability in the presence of context. The representation (78) follows from Definition 33 (operator formalism with $L_S$ on states and $K_S=L_S^\*$ on effects, with $K_S(I)=0$ ensuring normalization). The bound on $|\Delta P(i)|$ follows from Theorem 36, derived from the Fisher-Rao distance bound (Definition 33) and the operational definition of CC (Definition 30), constrained by causality (Theorem 39). The CTB expression (79) is Definition 34 with $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$. QED


## 13.2 Protocol 1: Accessible Born Rule Tests (QRNGs)

This protocol outlines a high-statistics, exploratory search for Born rule deviations (Theorem 51) using quantum random number generators (QRNGs) interacting with high-complexity systems (biological or potentially artificial).

*   **Objective:** To search for statistically significant deviations from *non-uniform* ($p_i \neq 0.5$) baseline Born rule probabilities in QRNG outputs that are correlated with the controlled internal state ($\text{context}_S$) of a proximate system S (human participant or specialized AI system) hypothesized to have CC > 0. Non-uniform baseline probabilities are preferred as they may facilitate easier statistical detection of small shifts relative to systematic noise and drift.

*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **QRNG:** Well-characterized QRNG producing stable, verifiable baseline probabilities $P_{Born}(i) \neq 0.5$ for some outcome $i$. Multiple parallel QRNGs can increase data rate.
    2.  **High-Complexity System (S):**
        *   *Biological:* Human participant performing standardized tasks generating specific internal states (`context_S`, e.g., focused attention/intention). Optional physiological monitoring (EEG, fMRI, HRV).
        *   *Artificial:* Sophisticated AI system. Major Challenge: Designing and verifying the physical interaction pathway $N(t)$ coupling the AI's internal $\text{context}_S$ (Definition L.1) to the QRNG's physical process, respecting constraints (speed, cost $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$, PCE, orthogonality to noise, mapping stability Theorem L.1). The electromagnetic channel dominates (Theorem L.5, $\mathcal{R} \sim 10^{36}$), requiring coherent field generation (Theorem L.2). Statistical requirements (Appendix L, Protocol L.1) and gravitational self-limitation (Appendix S) provide experimental benchmarks. This requires significant R&D and confirmation that the AI meets the operational criteria ($C_{agg}>C_{op}$) necessary for potential CC > 0.
    3.  **Interaction Control & Shielding:** Meticulous shielding (EM, thermal, acoustic, vibration). Well-defined interaction pathway $N(t)$. Measurement and control/compensation for conventional physical side-effects from S. Continuous environmental monitoring.
    4.  **Automation & Data Acquisition:** Automated randomization of conditions (baseline, neutral, specific context runs), synchronized recording of QRNG outcomes and `context_S` indicators, precise timestamps, secure storage for large datasets ($10^7 - 10^9+$ trials). Mandatory blinding procedures.

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Baseline Characterization:** Extensive data collection establishing baseline $P_{Born}(i)$, stability, and noise levels.
    2.  **Intervention Runs:** Randomized block design interleaving conditions (Baseline, Neutral Context, Specific Context). Collect large $N_{int}$ trials per condition.
    3.  **Control Conditions:** Include sham interaction runs (pathway $N(t)$ disabled) to control for conventional influences.

*   **Statistical Analysis and Power:**
    *   **Target Sensitivity:** The experiment aims to resolve CC-induced deviations $\Delta P$ from a baseline Born probability $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)$ with high statistical confidence (e.g., two-sided significance $\alpha = 0.01$ (continuity correction and a 5–8% conservative buffer applied), power $1-\beta = 0.80$).

*   **Prospective Sample Sizes:** The experiment aims to resolve CC-induced deviations $\Delta P$ from a baseline Born probability $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)$ with high statistical confidence (e.g., two-sided significance $\alpha = 0.01$, power $1-\beta = 0.80$). For a one-sample test comparing an observed proportion $p'$ in a context condition against a precisely calibrated baseline $p_0$ (treated as known), the required total sample size $N$ is given by the standard formula:
    $$
    N \approx \frac{ \left[ Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{ p_0(1-p_0) } + Z_\beta \sqrt{ p'(1-p') } \right]^2 }{ (p' - p_0)^2 }
    $$
where $Z_x$ is the critical value of the standard normal distribution. The precision of the baseline calibration for $p_0$ must be rigorously established and reported, as any uncertainty in $p_0$ will affect the required sample size and the interpretation of the results.
*   **Independence and Error Control:** Independence of trials will be rigorously assessed using autocorrelation functions (ACF), Ljung–Box tests, and Wald–Wolfowitz runs tests on the output streams and residuals. The NIST Statistical Test Suite (SP 800-22) will be applied to verify randomness properties. If correlations are detected, appropriate methods such as pre-whitening, block-bootstrap confidence intervals, or data thinning will be employed. Multiplicity of tests across outcomes or contexts will be controlled using standard methods (e.g., Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate or Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate).
*   **Sequential Analysis:** For high-statistics runs, a sequential analysis plan with pre-specified interim looks using O’Brien–Fleming-type boundaries (implemented via the Lan-DeMets error spending function [Lan & DeMets 1983]) is recommended. This allows for early stopping due to efficacy or futility while preserving the overall type-I error rate. The table below provides indicative total sample sizes ($N_{OBF}$) per context and expected stopping distributions under the alternative hypothesis for three equally spaced looks.

| α | δ | N_fixed | N_OBF (≈ 1.06 × N_fixed) | Expected stop % at looks 1/2/3 (under H₁) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.01 | 10⁻³ | 2,302,586 | 2,440,742 | ~5% / 20% / 75% |
| 0.01 | 5×10⁻⁴ | 9,210,341 | 9,762,962 | ~3% / 17% / 80% |
| 0.01 | 10⁻⁴ | 230,258,510 | 244,074,021 | ≲1% / 10% / 89% |
| 0.001 | 10⁻³ | 3,453,878 | 3,661,111 | ~4% / 18% / 78% |
| 0.001 | 5×10⁻⁴ | 13,815,511 | 14,644,442 | ~2% / 15% / 83% |
| 0.001 | 10⁻⁴ | 345,387,764 | 366,111,030 | ≲1% / 9% / 90% |

*   *Assumptions for $N_{\rm fixed}$ in the table:* **One-sample proportion** design with baseline $p=0.25$, power $1-\beta=0.80$.
    *   *Sequential design:* O’Brien–Fleming boundaries with **3 equally spaced** looks at cumulative information fractions $1/3, 2/3, 1$. The overhead factor (~1.06) and stop percentages are **illustrative**; exact values will be determined by the preregistered simulations and released with the code.

*   **Primary Analysis:** Pre-register goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., $\chi^2$, z-tests) comparing observed frequencies $\hat{P}(i)$ to the Born rule probabilities. Where applicable, exact binomial tests or variance-stabilized (arcsin–sqrt) transformations will complement normal approximations to ensure proper calibration, especially for small $\delta$. Design-stage baselines will use device-specific $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)$ estimates. Report effect sizes (Cramér’s V, Cohen’s d) with 95% CIs.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Model $\Delta\hat{P}(i)$ as a function of contextual variables `$context_S$` via mixed-effects logistic regression.
    *   **Systematic Error Control (Paramount):** (i) electronic drift (ii) detector after-pulsing (iii) clock-sync bias (iv) experimenter degrees-of-freedom (blinding).
    *   **Outcome:** Deviations that survive all controls give an empirical estimate of CC($S$) (cf. Theorem 51); null results tighten the exclusion curve $\text{CC}_{\max}(S) < \epsilon(N)$.

*   **Feasibility Assessment:** High statistics achievable. Shielding/control standard but requires extreme care. Biological context control depends on participants. AI interaction pathway is a major R&D challenge. Rigorous systematic error exclusion is the primary hurdle. Challenging but potentially feasible exploratory search.

**13.3 Prediction/Protocol 2: Exploratory Coherence Time Tests**

Investigates the secondary prediction that CC might influence quantum coherence (Proposition 13).

**13.3.1 Potential Effect on Coherence**

The CC influence mechanism (Hypothesis 3), by modulating 'Evolve'/ND-RID parameters contributing to decoherence, could potentially modify effective decoherence rates $\Gamma_{eff}$ or coherence times $\tau_{coh} = 1/\Gamma_{eff}$ of quantum systems interacting with a high-CC aggregate $S$.

**13.3.2 Phenomenological Model**

A possible model relates fractional change in coherence time to CC:
$$
\frac{\Delta \tau_{coh}}{\tau_{coh}} = -\frac{\Delta \Gamma_{eff}}{\Gamma_{eff}} \approx \gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}(S) \cdot f_{context}(\text{context}_S, \text{system}) \quad \text{(80)}
$$
where $\Delta \tau_{coh} = \tau_{coh, obs} - \tau_{coh, base}$, $\gamma'_{CC}$ is a coupling factor, and $f_{context} \in [-1, 1]$ captures context-system interaction. Sign depends on context.

**13.3.3 Experimental Approach**

*   **Objective:** Exploratory search for statistically significant *relative changes* in $\tau_{coh}$ correlated with `context_S` of system S.
*   **Setup:**
    *   **Quantum System:** System with well-characterized, long, stable baseline $\tau_{coh, base}$ (NV centers, trapped ions, qubits, NMR).
    *   **High-Complexity System (S):** Human or AI.
    *   **Interaction/Control:** Similar requirements as Protocol 1 (shielding, interaction $N(t)$, stability, blinding). Temperature stability critical.
*   **Procedure:** Measure $\tau_{coh}$ (e.g., Ramsey, spin echo, $T_1/T_2$) repeatedly under randomized conditions (baseline, neutral context, specific context). Rapid interleaving mitigates drifts. Residual autocorrelation will be diagnosed and, if present, mitigated by prewhitening (e.g., AR(1)).
*   **Analysis:** Detect small differences $\Delta \hat{\tau}_{coh} = \hat{\tau}_{coh, context} - \hat{\tau}_{coh, baseline}$. High precision/stability needed; effect size $|\Delta \tau_{coh}/\tau_{coh}| \approx |\gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}|$ may be small. Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) after rigorous systematic error checks (temperature, fields correlated with S).
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Technically demanding (high-precision $\tau_{coh}$ measurement). Requires specialized equipment/expertise. Sensitivity depends on achievable baseline stability $\sigma_{\tau_{coh, base}}$. Highly exploratory.

**13.4 Identifiability Against Electromagnetic Confounds**

A critical challenge for any experiment seeking to detect CC is to unambiguously distinguish the hypothesized effect from conventional physical influences, particularly subtle electromagnetic (EM) fields generated by the high-complexity system. The following protocol design creates a quantitative, verifiable gap between the maximum possible EM-induced bias and the potential CC signal floor.

**Theorem 53 (Identifiability against EM confounds)**

Consider a triple‑blind protocol with:

* (i) **DFS‑locked sensors**: two co‑located atomic‑clock qubits operated at a “magic” point with **zero first‑order** differential polarizability (Stark‑insensitive).
* (ii) **Reciprocity‑null geometry**: a Ramsey‑interferometric readout utilizing two **counter‑propagating** optical paths whose EM susceptibilities are equal and opposite. Consequently, any residual EM field produces equal shifts that **cancel** at the differenced detector output.
* (iii) **Algorithmic‑complexity shielding**: measurement bases chosen by a stream whose **min‑entropy per bit** $H_\infty\ge 0.999$ and **Kolmogorov complexity rate** $K/L \ge 0.99$, unknown to all labs until after data lock.

Then any *pure Maxwell* environment with residual EM **intensity** $I$ (Poynting magnitude), giving energy density $u = I/c$ in free space, incident on the sensors over interrogation time $T$ and with differential polarizability $\Delta\alpha$ at the magic point is bounded by:
$$
|\Delta P|_{\rm EM}\ \le\ \frac{\Delta\alpha}{4\,\hbar\,\varepsilon_0}\,u\,T
\quad\text{(mid‑fringe, small‑phase regime).}
\quad \text{(81)}
$$

*Derivation.* In a Ramsey interferometer at mid‑fringe, a small differential AC Stark shift $\Delta\omega$ between the two arms produces a phase shift $\Delta\phi=\Delta\omega\,T$. The probability bias satisfies $|\Delta P| = |\sin(\Delta\phi/2)| \approx |\Delta\phi|/2$ for small $\Delta\phi$. For a field with energy density $u$, the mean squared electric field is $\langle E^2 \rangle=u/\varepsilon_0$ (assuming linear polarization). The differential shift is $\Delta\omega=(\Delta\alpha/(2\hbar))\langle E^2 \rangle=(\Delta\alpha/(2\hbar\,\varepsilon_0))\,u$. Combining these results yields $|\Delta P|\approx (\Delta\alpha/(4\hbar\,\varepsilon_0))\,u\,T$, establishing the bound as stated.

A separate bound on algorithmic predictability confounds is given by $P_{\rm guess} \le 2^{-(H_\infty L - t)}$, where an adversary has at most $t$ bits of side-information. The **CC** effect predicted by PU, using the bounds from Theorem 51 (for $P_{Born}=1/2$), is
$$
|\Delta P|_{\rm PU}\ \lesssim\ \mathrm{CC}(S)/2.$$
Using representative achievable values of $|\Delta\alpha|\!\lesssim\!10^{-39}\,\mathrm{J\,m^2/V^2}$ and $u\!\lesssim\!10^{-18}\,\mathrm{J/m^3}$, we obtain
$|\Delta P|_{\rm EM}\ \lesssim\ 5.36\times 10^{-13}\,T$ (with $T$ in seconds). This yields $|\Delta P|_{\rm EM} \lesssim 5.4\times 10^{-13}$ at $T=1\,\mathrm{s}$, and $1.9\times 10^{-9}$ at $T=1\,\mathrm{hr}$. Consequently, any observed $|\Delta P|\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ **cannot** be attributed solely to these EM channels. In contrast, the PU framework predicts $|\Delta P|_{\rm PU}$ could potentially reach $\sim 10^{-4}$ (assuming $\mathrm{CC}(S) \sim 10^{-4}$).


**13.5 Prediction/Protocol 3: Exploratory Bell Tests / Statistical FTL Search**

Addresses the most speculative prediction: potential statistical FTL influence mediated by CC acting on entangled systems (Postulate 3).

*   **Objective:** Sensitive search for statistical dependence of Bob's local measurement outcomes on Alice's remote context `context_S` (associated with system $S_A$ at her station), with A and B space-like separated. Secondary search for context-dependent changes in Bell parameters.
*   **Theoretical Basis:** Postulate 3 allows Alice's context $C_A$ to influence Bob's marginal probabilities $P_{obs}(b|B, C_A)$, respecting Postulate 2 (no deterministic signaling). Detection requires $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ trials (Theorem 40).
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **Entanglement Source:** High-quality, stable source distributing entangled pairs to space-like separated stations (Alice, Bob).
    2.  **Measurement Stations (A, B):** Standard Bell test apparatus (independent, random settings $a, b$). High efficiency desirable. The setting generators are device‑independent and statistically independent of system $S$ and any hidden variables.
    3.  **High-Complexity System (S_A):** System S (human/AI) at Alice's station generating distinct contexts $C_{A,k}$.
    4.  **Interaction/Control (Alice):** Controlled pathway $N(t)$ linking $S_A$'s context $C_{A,k}$ to Alice's measurement/particle. Rigorous shielding/systematics control at both stations.
    5.  **Space-like Separation:** Ensure measurement events ($a, o_A$ and $b, o_B$) are space-like separated. Requires precise timing and separation.
    6.  **Data Acquisition:** Synchronized recording ($C_{A,k}, a, o_A, b, o_B$, timestamps) for billions of coincidences potentially needed. Mandatory blinding.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Standard Bell Test:** Verify entanglement, calibrate, establish baseline correlations $E(a,b)$.
    2.  **Context Intervention Runs:** Interleave runs with Alice generating contexts $C_{A,k}$ (e.g., $k=0, 1, 2$). Random settings $a, b$. Collect large statistics $N_{int}$ per context $k$.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   **Primary Focus (Statistical Influence):** Compare Bob's marginal probabilities $P(o_B | b, C_{A,k})$ across contexts $k$. Test the null hypothesis $H_0: P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=1}) = P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=2})$. Rejection supports Postulate 3. Estimate the shift $\Delta P_{marginal} = |P(o_B | b, C_{A,1}) - P(o_B | b, C_{A,2})|$. By Theorem 36, this shift is bounded by $\Delta P_{marginal} \lesssim \text{CC}(S_A)$. Detection requires $N_{int} \gtrsim O(1/\text{CC}^2)$ (Theorem 40).
    *   **Secondary Analysis (Correlations):** Calculate correlations $E(a,b)_k$ and Bell parameters $S_{CHSH, k}$ conditioned on context $k$. Look for differences $S_{CHSH, k=1} \neq S_{CHSH, k=2}$.
    *   **Systematic Error Control (Extreme Rigor):** Exclude conventional communication (light leaks, EM, acoustic), detector/setting correlations with $C_{A,k}$, statistical loopholes, biases.
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Extremely challenging. Requires state-of-the-art entanglement/measurement technology, robust space-like separation. Controlling systematics to demonstrate statistical FTL is extraordinarily difficult. Required statistics $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ can be immense. Highly exploratory; positive indication needs exceptional scrutiny/replication.

**13.6 Staged Experimental Approach and General Considerations**

A pragmatic, staged approach is recommended to systematically test the framework's predictions:

1.  **Stage 1 (Near-Term Focus):** High-statistics QRNG tests (Protocol 1). This protocol is the most accessible for either detecting a signal or placing meaningful upper bounds on CC in the range of $10^{-3} - 10^{-4}$. Success is contingent on meticulous QRNG and interaction-pathway design, rigorous systematics control, and achieving the required statistical power as outlined in the protocol's power analysis.
1.  **Stage 2 (Medium-Term):** If justified by positive and replicated results from Stage 1, coherence time tests (Protocol 2) should be pursued to seek complementary evidence. This stage would also involve refining the QRNG protocols based on initial findings.
2.  **Stage 3 (Long-Term / Contingent):** The extraordinarily demanding Bell-type experiments for a statistical FTL search (Protocol 3) should only be undertaken if compelling, independently verified evidence emerges from the earlier stages.

All proposed experiments share common requirements for rigor and validity. They necessitate quantum systems with high stability over long integration times to achieve the required statistical power. Given the multiple hypotheses being tested, a clear, pre-registered statistical plan is mandatory to control the family-wise error rate. This should include specifying the use of sequential analyses with pre-defined stopping rules (e.g., O’Brien–Fleming boundaries) to allow for early termination for efficacy or futility while preserving the overall type-I error rate. As a concrete example, with three equally spaced looks, the canonical OBF boundaries (Z-scores) at a family-wise $\alpha=0.05$ are approximately $[3.47, 2.45, 2.00]$.

**13.7 Compliance with Causal Constraints**

The experimental program, especially Protocol 3, probes the framework's non-standard locality. Causal consistency is maintained as follows:

**13.7.1 Theorem 52 (CC Compliance with Postulate 2)**

The Consciousness Complexity (CC) mechanism (Hypothesis 3), constrained by $\text{CC} \le \alpha_{CC,max} < 0.5$ (Theorem 39), is consistent with the framework's definition of causality (Postulate 2) because it prevents deterministic faster-than-light (FTL) signaling. The potential statistical FTL influence (Postulate 3) is inherently probabilistic and information-rate limited (Theorem 40, Theorem 41, consistent with bounds derived from ND-RID contractivity within the AQFT framework of Appendix F), making it unusable for constructing paradox-inducing causal loops (Theorem 42, whose consistency is supported by the AQFT analysis in Appendix F).
*Proof Summary:* Theorem 39 prevents outcome forcing. Theorem 40 shows detection needs $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$. Theorem 41 bounds information rate $I \propto \text{CC}^2$. Theorem 42 proves this noisy, rate-limited channel cannot achieve deterministic signaling needed for causal loops. The full consistency analysis, including the role of emergent operator locality and information-rate limits, is provided in **Appendix F**. QED

*Note:* Empirical investigation of Postulate 3 (Protocol 3) critically tests this unique aspect of PU's locality/causality. Confirmation requires re-evaluating standard locality; null results constrain/falsify this prediction.

**13.8 High-Precision Falsification Windows**

Beyond the direct experimental search for CC, the framework's quantitative predictions for fundamental constants and emergent gravity provide sharp, falsifiable tests.

**13.8.1 The Fine-Structure Constant Prediction Window**
The framework predicts the Thomson-limit fine-structure constant $\alpha^{-1} ≈ 137.036 \pm 0.0001$ directly from the PCE-Attractor structure (Appendix Z, Theorem Z.26). This value agrees with the experimental value $\alpha^{-1}_{\mathrm{exp}} = 137.035999084(21)$ to 0.68 ppm, within the theoretical uncertainty. The prediction is falsifiable: if future measurements of $\alpha(0)$ deviate from this value beyond the stated uncertainty, the PCE-Attractor model for the origin of the U(1) coupling would be invalidated. As a consistency check, applying standard QED running from this Thomson-limit value yields $\alpha^{-1}(M_Z) \approx 127.93$, in agreement with experiment (Appendix Z, Corollary Z.8).

**13.8.2 The Multi-Scale Gravity / Dark Sector Window**
The framework's two-mechanism model for the dark sector (Appendix I) is falsifiable through its demand for cross-scale consistency with a minimal set of universal parameters. The model can be falsified in several ways:
*   **Failure to Fit Galaxies:** If the scale-dependent $G(R)$ model (Equation I.4) fails to provide good fits to a large, diverse sample of galaxy rotation curves (e.g., the SPARC database) with a single, universal set of parameters $(L_0, A_G, m)$, the galaxy-scale mechanism is invalidated.
*   **Consistency with Early-Universe Constraints:** The galaxy-fit value for the asymptotic enhancement, $A_G$, must remain consistent with cosmological constraints on the effective gravitational coupling during recombination (e.g., CMB/BBN). A model that requires a larger $A_G$ to fit galaxies would be falsified.
*   **Failure to Fit Clusters:** The non-local predictive matter model (Equation I.7) must be able to fit the observed lensing profiles of massive galaxy clusters (like Abell 1689 and stacked samples) using a **universal nonlinearity exponent $q$** and either a **universal kernel scale $L_0$ or one derivable from ND–RID microphysics (allowing mild environment dependence)**, with per‑cluster amplitudes $A_{\rm PM}$ bounded by baryon budgets. If no such consistent fit can be found, the cluster-scale mechanism is invalidated.
*   **Parameter Incoherence:** The parameters derived from fitting galaxies (e.g., the transition scale $L_0$) and clusters (e.g., the kernel scale $L_0$ and the universal exponent $q$) must be coherently related by the underlying theory. A significant, unexplainable discrepancy between the best-fit parameters for the two regimes would falsify the claim of a unified underlying mechanism.

**Preregistration:** All primary endpoints, inference procedures, stopping rules, and exclusion criteria must be preregistered (e.g., via OSF/AsPredicted). Any deviations from the pre-registered plan must be explicitly documented and justified.

**Data and Code Availability:** All analysis scripts (including power and sample-size simulations), anonymized raw data, experimental logs, and time-stamps (with random seeds where applicable) will be made publicly available at a persistent repository to ensure full transparency and reproducibility. The preregistration will link directly to this repository.



## 13.9 Prediction 4: Quantum Error Correction Optimality from PCE Structure

Beyond the CC-specific predictions of Sections 13.1–13.5, the PU framework makes a structural prediction concerning optimal quantum error correction: the parameters of the uniquely optimal error-correcting code should coincide with the PCE-Attractor structure derived in Appendix Z. This prediction has empirical support from existing quantum computing research, providing an independent validation pathway for the framework's core mathematical architecture.

### 13.9.1 Theorem 54 (PCE-Optimal Error Correction Parameters)

The Principle of Compression Efficiency (Definition 15), applied to the $M = 24$ QFI-active interface modes at the PCE-Attractor (Definition 15a), uniquely selects error-correcting code parameters $[n, k, d] = [24, 12, 8]$.

*Proof Summary:* The full derivation appears in Appendix Z (Theorem Z.13b) and Appendix R (Theorem R.4.4). The key steps are:

**Step 1 (Block length from QFI mode count).** The number of QFI-active modes is fixed by the thermodynamic partition (Theorem Z.1):

$$M = 2ab = 2 \times 2 \times 6 = 24$$

where $a = 2$ from Landauer-PPI correspondence and $b = d_0 - a = 6$. This sets block length $n = M = 24$.

**Step 2 (Rate from PCE symmetry).** At the PCE-Attractor, the QFI spectrum is flat with $\lambda = 1$ for all modes (Theorem Z.5). This isotropy implies equal operational costs and benefits per mode. The PCE potential for error-correcting codes:

$$V_{\text{code}}[n, k, d] = V_{\text{capacity}}(n-2k) + V_{\text{error}}(d)$$

is minimized at $k = n/2 = 12$, yielding rate $R = 1/2$.

**Step 3 (Distance from bound saturation).** With $(n, k) = (24, 12)$ fixed, PCE minimizes $V_{\text{error}}(d)$ by maximizing minimum distance $d$. The Griesmer bound for binary linear codes establishes $d \leq 8$ for these parameters (MacWilliams & Sloane 1977). The extended binary Golay code $\mathcal{G}_{24}$ uniquely achieves this bound.

**Step 4 (Uniqueness).** The Golay code is unique up to equivalence among linear $[24, 12, 8]$ codes (Pless 1968; extended to all codes by Delsarte & Goethals 1975). PCE isotropy precludes preference among equivalent representations. Therefore, PCE optimization uniquely selects the Golay $[24, 12, 8]$ structure. ∎

### 13.9.2 Corollary 54.1 (Code-Substrate Alignment Hypothesis)

If the physical quantum substrate exhibits structure aligned with the PCE-Attractor, then error-correcting codes matching the PCE-optimal parameters $[24, 12, 8]$ should demonstrate superior performance—potentially exceeding predictions based solely on mathematical distance bounds—compared to codes with different structural parameters.

*Rationale:* Standard coding theory establishes that the Golay code saturates mathematical bounds (Hamming, Griesmer, Singleton). However, if the PCE-Attractor structure reflects genuine physical substrate organization, codes aligned with this structure may benefit from reduced effective noise, improved syndrome extraction fidelity, or enhanced logical gate performance. This creates a discriminating prediction between PU and standard quantum information theory.

### 13.9.3 Empirical Evidence from Existing Literature

Comparative studies in quantum error correction provide support for the Golay code's exceptional performance:

**Evidence 1: Fault-Tolerance Threshold**

Cross, DiVincenzo, and Terhal (2009) conducted a comprehensive comparative study of quantum codes for fault tolerance using the Aliferis-Gottesman-Preskill (AGP) extended rectangle method. Their analysis of codes ranging from the 7-qubit Steane code to various Bacon-Shor and surface codes found that the quantum Golay code achieved the highest level-1 depolarizing pseudo-threshold in their study, at $(2.25 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{-3}$. This threshold exceeded that of many codes with both smaller and larger block sizes.

**Evidence 2: Gigaquop-Scale Performance**

Ibe et al. (2025) demonstrated measurement-based fault-tolerant quantum computation comparing the Steane code $[[7,1,3]]$ and Golay code $[[23,1,7]]$ under circuit-level depolarizing noise. Their results confirm that both codes achieve their theoretically expected error scaling:

| Code | Parameters | Error Scaling | Computational Regime |
|------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Steane | $[[7,1,3]]$ | $O(p^2)$ | Megaquop (~$10^6$ T gates) |
| Golay | $[[23,1,7]]$ | $O(p^4)$ | Gigaquop (>$2 \times 10^9$ T gates) |

At physical error rate $p = 10^{-4}$, the Golay code supports approximately **800 times more operations** than the Steane code. The scaling exponents match theoretical expectations: for a distance-$d$ code, the logical error rate scales as $O(p^{\lfloor(d+1)/2\rfloor})$, giving $p^2$ for $d=3$ (Steane) and $p^4$ for $d=7$ (Golay).

*Interpretation:* This result confirms that the Golay code's theoretical optimality translates directly into practical performance advantages. When researchers sought the best code for maximum fault-tolerant performance on high-connectivity hardware, they independently selected the code that PU identifies as fundamental. While this is consistent with standard coding theory (higher distance yields better scaling), it validates that the PCE-optimal structure delivers real computational value—the 24-dimensional organization is not merely mathematically elegant but practically superior.

**Evidence 3: Practical Deployment in Classical Communication**

The classical Golay code's exceptional performance is validated by real-world deployment in high-reliability communication systems:

- **Voyager 1 & 2 spacecraft** (1979–1981): The Golay code replaced the Reed-Muller code for color image transmission from Jupiter and Saturn, enabling higher data rates within constrained bandwidth (Curtis 2016).
- **MIL-STD-188**: U.S. military standard for automatic link establishment in HF radio systems employs Golay-based error correction (Johnson 1991).

*Note:* These classical deployments demonstrate the code's practical superiority but do not directly test the quantum substrate alignment hypothesis.

**Evidence 4: Structural Properties**

The extended binary Golay code possesses exceptional structural properties:

- Self-duality of the parent code
- Mathieu group $M_{24}$ symmetry
- Connection to the Leech lattice $\Lambda_{24}$ via the gluing construction (Conway & Sloane 1999)

These mathematical properties suggest the code occupies a special position in the space of possible error-correcting structures.

### 13.9.4 Theoretical Interpretation: Why the Golay Code?

The PU framework provides a principled explanation for Golay optimality:

**Standard Theory:** The Golay code is optimal because it saturates mathematical bounds. This is correct but does not explain *why* these particular bounds are physically relevant or why nature should "prefer" this structure.

**PU Explanation:** The Golay code parameters emerge necessarily from the PCE-Attractor structure:

1. $n = 24$ from QFI mode count $M = 2ab$ (Theorem Z.5)
2. $k = 12$ from PCE symmetric optimization at rate $R = 1/2$ (Theorem Z.13b)
3. $d = 8$ from maximum distance at these constraints (Theorem R.4.4)

The code's exceptional properties—self-duality, Mathieu group $M_{24}$ symmetry, connection to the Leech lattice $\Lambda_{24}$—are consequences of this fundamental alignment, not coincidences.

### 13.9.5 Theorem 55 (Structural Unity of Golay-Leech-Attractor)

The extended binary Golay code $\mathcal{G}_{24}$, the Leech lattice $\Lambda_{24}$, and the PCE-Attractor state are unified manifestations of the same underlying optimization principle:

$$\text{PCE optimization} \xrightarrow{M=24} \mathcal{G}_{24} \xrightarrow{\text{gluing}} \Lambda_{24} \xrightarrow{K(D)=24} D=4 \xrightarrow{\text{emergence}} \text{spacetime}$$

*Proof:* See Appendix R (Theorem R.4.9, "The Golay Bridge") and Appendix Z (Theorem Z.13). The chain proceeds as follows:

- PCE optimization on $M = 24$ modes selects the Golay code (Theorem Z.13b)
- The Golay code provides glue vectors for constructing $\Lambda_{24}$ from $\sqrt{2}E_8^3$ (Lemma R.4.5)
- The Leech lattice has kissing number 196,560, but the *dimension* 24 matches the unique $D$ where $K(D) = 24$ (Theorem Z.10)
- Mode-channel matching $M_{\text{int}} = K(D) = 24$ selects $D = 4$ (Theorem Z.11)

Each step follows uniquely from the previous under PCE constraints. ∎

### 13.9.6 Classical vs. Quantum Golay Codes

The framework's prediction concerns the classical extended binary Golay code $[24, 12, 8]$, whose parameters directly reflect the PCE-Attractor structure. The principal quantum code derived from this classical code is:

| Code | Parameters | Construction |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Classical extended Golay | $[24, 12, 8]$ | PCE-optimal (Theorem 54) |
| Quantum Golay (CSS) | $[[23, 1, 7]]$ | Punctured CSS construction |

The $[[23, 1, 7]]$ quantum code is the most commonly studied variant for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Its distance $d = 7$ (vs. classical $d = 8$) reflects the CSS construction overhead. Experimental tests of the substrate alignment hypothesis (Protocol 4) should focus on this code and structurally similar alternatives.

**Remark on Quantum Bounds.** The quantum Hamming bound constrains achievable parameters for nondegenerate quantum codes. For a $[[n, k, d]]$ code with $t = \lfloor(d-1)/2\rfloor$ correctable errors, the bound requires:

$$\sum_{j=0}^{t} 3^j \binom{n}{j} \leq 2^{n-k}$$

The $[[23, 1, 7]]$ quantum Golay code satisfies this bound, achieving the maximum distance compatible with its block length and rate.

### 13.9.7 Protocol 4: Discriminating Tests for Substrate Alignment

To distinguish the PU explanation from standard coding theory, we propose targeted experimental comparisons:

**Protocol 4.1: Structural Comparison at Fixed Parameters**

*Objective:* Compare performance of Golay-structured codes against alternative codes with similar mathematical parameters but different internal structure.

*Method:*

1. Implement the $[[23, 1, 7]]$ quantum Golay code on high-connectivity hardware (trapped ions, neutral atoms)
2. Implement alternative CSS codes with comparable $[[n, k, d]]$ parameters (e.g., randomly constructed $[[23, 1, \leq 7]]$ stabilizer codes)
3. Measure logical error rates under identical physical noise conditions
4. Compare observed performance ratios against theoretical predictions from distance alone

*PU Prediction:* Golay-structured codes outperform alternatives by a margin exceeding that predicted by distance differences alone.

*Null Hypothesis:* Performance differences are fully explained by mathematical distance bounds.

**Protocol 4.2: Rate Optimality Test**

*Objective:* Verify that rate $R = 1/2$ represents an optimal operating point.

*Method:*

1. Construct a family of $[24, k, d(k)]$ codes with varying $k \in \{8, 10, 12, 14, 16\}$
2. Measure logical fidelity per physical qubit across the family
3. Determine empirical optimal rate $R^*_{\text{emp}}$

*PU Prediction:* $R^*_{\text{emp}} = 0.5 \pm \epsilon$ with $\epsilon \ll 0.1$, matching PCE-optimal rate.

*Alternative:* Optimal rate depends on noise model and shows no preference for $R = 1/2$.

**Protocol 4.3: Block Length Optimality Test**

*Objective:* Determine whether $n = 24$ represents a preferred block length.

*Method:*

1. Compare families of optimal codes at block lengths $n \in \{16, 20, 24, 28, 32\}$
2. Normalize for qubit count: measure logical error rate per physical qubit
3. Assess whether $n = 24$ shows disproportionate advantage

*PU Prediction:* The $n = 24$ family shows disproportionate advantage, reflecting substrate alignment.

*Null Hypothesis:* Performance scales smoothly with $n$; no special status for $n = 24$.

**Feasibility Assessment:** Protocol 4 is implementable with current quantum computing technology. High-connectivity platforms (trapped ions, neutral atoms, superconducting circuits with all-to-all connectivity) can implement 24-qubit logical blocks. The main experimental challenges are:

- Achieving sufficient syndrome extraction fidelity to distinguish PCE-alignment effects from implementation noise
- Controlling for noise model dependencies across different code families
- Obtaining sufficient statistics to detect potentially small performance differences

Near-term implementations could begin with Protocol 4.1 on existing 20–50 qubit systems.

### 13.9.8 Quantitative Predictions and Falsification Criteria

**Prediction 4.1 (Threshold Enhancement):** The fault-tolerance threshold $p_{\text{th}}$ for Golay-structured codes satisfies:

$$p_{\text{th}}^{\text{Golay}} \geq 1.2 \times p_{\text{th}}^{\text{generic}}$$

where $p_{\text{th}}^{\text{generic}}$ is the threshold for codes of comparable distance but non-Golay structure.

**Prediction 4.2 (Rate-½ Optimality):** Among codes with block length $n = 24$, the rate $R = 1/2$ achieves minimum logical error rate per physical qubit across diverse noise models.

**Falsification Criteria:**

The substrate alignment hypothesis (Corollary 54.1) is falsified if:

1. Golay codes show no statistically significant advantage over random $[[24, 12, \leq 8]]$ codes at $p < 0.05$ significance level, after controlling for distance
2. Block lengths other than $n = 24$ prove systematically superior for rate-$1/2$ codes across multiple noise models
3. Rate $R \neq 1/2$ proves optimal for $n = 24$ codes across diverse noise models
4. The observed threshold ratio satisfies $p_{\text{th}}^{\text{Golay}}/p_{\text{th}}^{\text{generic}} < 1.1$ within measurement uncertainty

### 13.9.9 Implications for Quantum Computing Engineering

If the substrate alignment hypothesis is supported by experimental evidence, the implications for quantum computing architecture include:

1. **Code Selection:** The Golay code and its relatives (punctured Golay, Golay-based concatenated codes) merit priority consideration for fault-tolerant implementations, particularly on high-connectivity platforms.

2. **Block Architecture:** Quantum processors designed with 24-qubit logical blocks as fundamental units may achieve more efficient error correction than arbitrary block sizes.

3. **Concatenation Strategy:** The 12+12 signal-parity structure of the Golay code suggests natural concatenation hierarchies preserving this symmetry.

4. **Hardware-Code Co-design:** Physical qubit layouts optimized for Golay syndrome extraction may achieve performance exceeding generic topological codes (surface codes) despite the latter's geometric locality advantages on planar architectures.

### 13.9.10 Relationship to Other Predictions

The Golay alignment prediction connects to other PU predictions through the unified PCE-Attractor structure:

| Prediction | Source | Connection to $M = 24$ |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Fine-structure constant $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.036$ | Section 13.8.1, Appendix Z | Capacity saturation at PCE-Attractor |
| Spacetime dimensionality $D = 4$ | Appendix H, Theorem Z.11 | Kissing number $K(4) = 24$ |
| Vacuum stability | Appendix Z, Proposition Z.13a | Leech lattice rootlessness from Golay $d = 8$ |
| Gauge group structure | Appendix W | $\dim[\mathfrak{g}_{\text{SM}}] = 12 = k$ |

This web of interconnected predictions—all flowing from the single structure $(a, b, d_0) = (2, 6, 8)$ and the PCE optimization principle—provides robust cross-validation opportunities. Confirmation or falsification in any domain constrains the others.

### 13.9.11 Summary

The PU framework predicts that the extended binary Golay code $[24, 12, 8]$ represents the uniquely optimal error-correcting structure, with parameters derived from first principles via PCE optimization. Existing empirical evidence provides supporting validation:

| Finding | Source | Status | PU Interpretation |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Golay achieves competitive threshold (~$2 \times 10^{-3}$) | Cross et al. (2009) | Established | Consistent with PCE-optimal parameters |
| Golay enables gigaquop-scale computation (>$10^9$ T gates) | Ibe et al. (2025) | Recent | Practical validation of theoretical optimality |
| Golay achieves $p^4$ scaling (as expected for $d=7$) | Ibe et al. (2025) | Recent | Distance bounds realized in practice |
| Golay deployed in critical classical systems | Voyager, MIL-STD-188 | Established | Practical validation of code superiority |
| Unique mathematical properties (self-duality, $M_{24}$, $\Lambda_{24}$) | Conway & Sloane (1999) | Established | Structural alignment with PCE-Attractor |

The evidence confirms that the Golay code's theoretical optimality—predicted by PU from first principles—translates into practical performance advantages. While the existing evidence is *consistent with* rather than *discriminating for* PU (standard coding theory also predicts Golay excellence), Protocol 4 provides methodology to test whether the code's performance exceeds distance-based predictions, which would constitute discriminating evidence for substrate alignment.

This constitutes an independent validation pathway for the PU framework, complementing the CC-focused protocols of Sections 13.2–13.5.

## 13.10 Consolidated Falsifiability Analysis

The framework generates parameter-free predictions that can be tested against observation. This section catalogs the primary falsifiable predictions derived in the technical appendices, specifies the conditions under which each would be refuted, and summarizes current experimental status.

### 13.10.1 Spacetime Dimension

**Prediction:** Emergent spacetime has exactly $D = 4$ macroscopic dimensions.

**Derivation Summary:** The mode-channel correspondence (Theorem Z.10) requires $M_{\mathrm{int}} = M_{\mathrm{phys}} = K(D)$ at thermodynamic equilibrium, where $K(D)$ is the kissing number in $D$ dimensions. With $M_{\mathrm{int}} = 2ab = 24$ (Theorem Z.5), the equation $K(D) = 24$ has unique solution $D = 4$ (Theorem Z.11).

**Falsification Conditions:**
- Discovery of large extra dimensions accessible at collider energies
- Gravitational force law deviating from $1/r^2$ at any experimentally accessible scale
- Detection of Kaluza-Klein excitations indicating compact extra dimensions

**Robustness:** The discrete nature of kissing numbers provides stability. The mode count $M = 24$ would need to change by at least 7 (to $M \leq 17$ or $M \geq 31$) to permit alternative dimensionality, since $K(3) = 12$ and $K(5) = 40$.

**Current Status:** All observations consistent with $D = 4$. Gravitational inverse-square law confirmed to $\sim 52\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ (Lee *et al.* 2020). LHC searches exclude large extra dimensions to multi-TeV scales (ATLAS Collaboration 2021).


### 13.10.2 Fine-Structure Constant

**Prediction:** At the Thomson limit (zero momentum transfer):
$$
\alpha^{-1}_{\mathrm{theory}} = 137.036092 \pm 0.000050
$$

**Derivation Summary:** Theorem Z.26 combines bulk, interface, and curvature contributions:
$$
\alpha^{-1} = \frac{4\pi}{u^*} - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{K_0}} + \frac{\pi u^*}{24\sqrt{K_0}}\left(1 - \frac{u^{*2}}{6}\right)
$$
where $u^* = 2^{1/8} - 1$ (Theorem Z.7) and $K_0 = 3$ (Theorem 15).

**Falsification Conditions:**
- Precision measurements yielding $\alpha^{-1}$ outside the range $137.0360 \pm 0.0002$ ($4\sigma$ envelope)
- Energy dependence of $\alpha$ inconsistent with standard QED running from this Thomson-limit value
- Spatial or temporal variation of $\alpha$ at levels exceeding $10^{-6}$ per Gyr

**Current Status:**
$$
\alpha^{-1}_{\mathrm{exp}} = 137.035999084(21) \quad \text{(Tiesinga \textit{et al.} 2021)}
$$
Discrepancy: $+0.000093 \pm 0.000050$ ($\sim 1.9\sigma$, 0.68 ppm). Consistent within theoretical uncertainty.

**Consistency Check:** Standard QED running from this Thomson-limit value yields $\alpha^{-1}(M_Z) \approx 127.93$ (Corollary Z.8), consistent with the experimental value $127.952 \pm 0.009$ (Particle Data Group 2024).

---

### 13.10.3 Generation Number

**Prediction:** Exactly $N_{\mathrm{gen}} = 3$ generations of Standard Model fermions.

**Derivation Summary:** Three generations emerge from two independent mechanisms:

1. **Topological:** Anomaly cancellation on $\Sigma_8 = U(8)/U(1)^8$ with CP violation requirements selects family charges $\{a, -a, 0\}$ (Theorem R.3.4, Proposition R.3.5).

2. **Geometric:** The interface mode factorization $M = 24 = 8 \times 3 = d_0 \times N_{\mathrm{gen}}$ provides structural consistency (Theorem Z.5, Appendix R Section R.4).

**Falsification Conditions:**
- Discovery of fourth-generation quarks or leptons at colliders
- Cosmological evidence for fourth light neutrino species ($N_\nu > 3.2$ at 95% CL)
- Z-pole width measurement inconsistent with three light neutrino families

**Current Status:**
$$
N_\nu = 2.9840 \pm 0.0082 \quad \text{(ALEPH \textit{et al.} 2006)}
$$
Fully consistent with $N_{\mathrm{gen}} = 3$. Direct searches exclude vectorlike quarks that decay to a $W$ boson and a light quark with masses below $\sim 1.5\ \mathrm{TeV}$ (ATLAS Collaboration 2024).


---

### 13.10.4 Gauge Group Structure

**Prediction:** The Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}} = SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ is uniquely selected.

**Derivation Summary:** Sections G.8.4–G.8.5 establish uniqueness through anomaly cancellation, capacity constraints ($n_G \leq 12$), and PCE optimization. The generator count $n_G = 8 + 3 + 1 = 12$ saturates the Lagrangian capacity bound (Theorem G.8.4b).

**Conditional Status:** This prediction depends on Conjecture G.M1. While Theorem G.8.4b verifies the conjecture's consequences through exhaustive partition analysis, the conjecture itself is not yet proven from axioms.

**Falsification Conditions:**
- Discovery of additional gauge bosons ($Z'$, $W'$) at accessible energies indicating enlarged gauge group
- Detection of new long-range forces indicating additional $U(1)$ factors

**Current Status:** No evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model gauge structure. LHC searches for $Z'$ and $W'$ negative to multi-TeV scales (ATLAS Collaboration 2019; CMS Collaboration 2022).


---

### 13.10.5 Mass Hierarchy Invariant

**Prediction:** The mass hierarchy invariant takes discrete values:
$$
\mathcal{R} := \frac{\ln(m_3/m_1)}{\ln(m_3/m_2)} \in \left\{\frac{4}{3}, \frac{3}{2}, 2, 3, 4\right\}
$$

**Derivation Summary:** Equation R.17 derives $\mathcal{R} = d^2_{31}/d^2_{32}$ from $E_8$ root geometry, where the squared geodesic distances between generation vacua satisfy $d^2 \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ (Section R.5).

**Falsification Conditions:**
- Precision mass measurements yielding $\mathcal{R}$ values unambiguously between discrete predictions
- Failure of the invariant to match discrete values in multiple fermion sectors simultaneously

**Current Status (Charged Leptons):**

Using PDG 2024 values (Particle Data Group 2024):
$$
\mathcal{R}_\ell^{\mathrm{exp}} = \frac{\ln(m_\tau/m_e)}{\ln(m_\tau/m_\mu)} = \frac{\ln(3477.2)}{\ln(16.82)} = 2.889
$$

Closest discrete value: $\mathcal{R} = 3$, corresponding to $(d^2_{31}, d^2_{32}) = (6, 2)$. Deviation: 3.7%, within the theoretical uncertainty of $\sim 5\%$ arising from QED radiative corrections ($\sim \alpha/\pi \approx 0.2\%$ per mass, combining to $\sim 1\%$ on $\mathcal{R}$) and threshold matching effects ($\sim 1\%$), with a factor of $\sim 2$ for higher-order contributions.

### 13.10.6 Summary Table

**Table 13.1: Falsifiable Predictions and Current Status**

| Prediction | Framework Value | Experimental Value | Derivation | Status |
|:-----------|:----------------|:-------------------|:-----------|:------:|
| Spacetime dimension $D$ | 4 | 4 | Theorem Z.11 | ✓ |
| Fine-structure constant $\alpha^{-1}$ | $137.0361 \pm 0.0001$ | $137.035999084(21)$ | Theorem Z.26 | ✓ |
| Generation number $N_{\mathrm{gen}}$ | 3 | $2.984 \pm 0.008$ | Proposition R.3.5 | ✓ |

| Lepton hierarchy $\mathcal{R}_\ell$ | 3 | 2.889 (3.7% dev.) | Equation R.17 | ✓ |

All predictions are currently consistent with observation. The framework will be falsified if any prediction falls outside its stated uncertainty bounds in future precision measurements.

---

### 13.10.7 Theoretical Error Budget

| Prediction | Dominant Uncertainty Source | Estimated Magnitude |
|:-----------|:---------------------------|:--------------------|
| $\alpha^{-1}$ | Fifth-order terms $O(u^{*5})$ with $100\times$ safety factor | $\pm 0.000050$ |
| $\mathcal{R}$ | QED radiative corrections ($\sim 1\%$), threshold effects ($\sim 1\%$), higher-order ($\times 2$) | $\sim 5\%$ |
| $N_{\mathrm{gen}}$ | None (topologically exact) | 0 |
| $D$ | None (combinatorially exact) | 0 |

The predictions for $D$ and $N_{\mathrm{gen}}$ are exact within the framework; any deviation would falsify the foundational structure rather than indicate theoretical uncertainty.
