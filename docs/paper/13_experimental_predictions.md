# 13 Experimental Predictions and Protocols

The Predictive Universe framework, particularly the Consciousness Complexity (CC) hypothesis (Section 9) proposing a mechanism by which complex MPU aggregates can influence quantum outcomes, leads to specific, potentially falsifiable predictions that deviate from standard quantum mechanics. This section details these predictions and outlines experimental protocols designed for their investigation, emphasizing near-term feasibility while acknowledging the significant challenges involved in detecting potentially subtle effects.

**13.1 Prediction 1: Potential Born-Rule Deviations**

The core testable prediction of the CC hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) is that systems $S$ with sufficiently high aggregate complexity ($C_{agg} > C_{op}$) and non-zero operational CC(S) > 0 (Definition 30) can induce statistically significant deviations from the standard Born rule probabilities (Proposition 7) when interacting with a quantum system undergoing an 'Evolve' event (e.g., measurement).

**13.1.1 Theorem 51 (Quantitative Born Rule Deviation Prediction)**

Consider a quantum system prepared in state $\rho$ (pure case $\rho=\lvert\psi\rangle\!\langle\psi\rvert$) measured by a POVM $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Let $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho E_i)$ be the Born probability of outcome $i$. If this interaction occurs within the influencing context `context_S(i)` provided by an MPU aggregate system $S$ possessing operational $\mathrm{CC}(S)>0$, the predicted observable probability $P_{obs}(i)$ is

$$
P_{obs}(i)=P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)+\Delta P(i)\quad \text{(77)}
$$

where the deviation is generated by the probability-modification maps of Definition 33:

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(L_S(\rho)\,E_i\big)=\mathrm{tr}\!\big(\rho\,K_S(E_i)\big),\qquad K_S(I)=0 \quad \text{(78)}
$$

and is bounded by the CC norm,

$$
\lvert \Delta P(i)\rvert \le \|L_S\|_{\mathrm{op}}=\mathrm{CC}(S)\le \alpha_{\mathrm{CC,max}}<0.5 .
$$

Moreover, for every POVM ${E_i}$ and any state $\rho$, impose the positivity‑preserving effect constraint

$$
0 \le E \le I \ \Longrightarrow\ -E \ \le\ K_S(E)\ \le\ I - E ,
$$

which, together with $K_S(I)=0$, ensures $0 \le P_{\mathrm{obs}}(i) \le 1$ for all outcomes while preserving $\sum_i P_{\mathrm{obs}}(i)=1$.


Using the **Context-Targeted Bias (CTB)** model (Definition 34), where the context defines a target state $\sigma_S$ and $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$, the deviation takes the form

$$
\Delta P(i)=\mathrm{CC}(S)\,\big(p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)-P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)\big)\quad \text{(79)}
$$

*Proof:* (77) is the definition of observable probability in the presence of context. The representation (78) follows from Definition 33 (operator formalism with $L_S$ on states and $K_S=L_S^\*$ on effects, with $K_S(I)=0$ ensuring normalization). The bound $|\Delta P(i)|\le \mathrm{CC}(S)$ follows from Definition 30 with $\mathrm{CC}(S)=\|L_S\|_{\mathrm{op}}$ and Theorem 39. The CTB expression (79) is Definition 34 with $p_{\mathrm{target}}(S,i)=\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_S E_i)$. QED




## 13.2 Protocol 1: Accessible Born Rule Tests (QRNGs)

This protocol outlines a high-statistics, exploratory search for Born rule deviations (Theorem 51) using quantum random number generators (QRNGs) interacting with high-complexity systems (biological or potentially artificial).

*   **Objective:** To search for statistically significant deviations from *non-uniform* ($p_i \neq 0.5$) baseline Born rule probabilities in QRNG outputs that are correlated with the controlled internal state ($\text{context}_S$) of a proximate system S (human participant or specialized AI system) hypothesized to have CC > 0. Non-uniform baseline probabilities are preferred for potentially easier statistical detection of small shifts relative to noise.

*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **QRNG:** Well-characterized QRNG producing stable, verifiable baseline probabilities $P_{Born}(i) \neq 0.5$ for some outcome $i$. Multiple parallel QRNGs can increase data rate.
    2.  **High-Complexity System (S):**
        *   *Biological:* Human participant performing standardized tasks generating specific internal states (`context_S`, e.g., focused attention/intention). Optional physiological monitoring (EEG, fMRI, HRV).
        *   *Artificial:* Sophisticated AI system. Major Challenge: Designing and verifying the physical interaction pathway $N(t)$ coupling AI's internal `context_S` (Definition L.1) to the QRNG's physical process, respecting constraints (speed, cost $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$, PCE, orthogonality to noise, mapping stability Theorem L.1). Requires significant R&D (Appendix L). Requires confirmation AI meets operational criteria ($C_{agg}>C_{op}$) for potential CC > 0.
    3.  **Interaction Control & Shielding:** Meticulous shielding (EM, thermal, acoustic, vibration). Well-defined interaction pathway $N(t)$. Measurement and control/compensation for conventional physical side-effects from S. Continuous environmental monitoring.
    4.  **Automation & Data Acquisition:** Automated randomization of conditions (baseline, neutral, specific context runs), synchronized recording of QRNG outcomes and `context_S` indicators, precise timestamps, secure storage for large datasets ($10^7 - 10^9+$ trials). Mandatory blinding procedures.

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Baseline Characterization:** Extensive data collection establishing baseline $P_{Born}(i)$, stability, and noise levels.
    2.  **Intervention Runs:** Randomized block design interleaving conditions (Baseline, Neutral Context, Specific Context). Collect large $N_{int}$ trials per condition.
    3.  **Control Conditions:** Include sham interaction runs (pathway $N(t)$ disabled) to control for conventional influences.

*   **Statistical Analysis and Power:**
    *   **Target Sensitivity:** The experiment aims to resolve CC-induced deviations $\Delta P$ from a baseline Born probability $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)$ with high statistical confidence (e.g., two-sided significance $\alpha = 0.01$, power $1-\beta = 0.80$).
    *   **Prospective Sample Sizes:** For comparing two proportions $p_1, p_2$ (e.g., context vs. control), a per-arm sample size is `N_per-arm ≈ ([Z_α/2√(2p̄(1-p̄)) + Z_β√(p₁(1-p₁)+p₂(1-p₂))]²)/(p₂-p₁)²`, with `p̄=(p₁+p₂)/2`. For a single-proportion shift from $p$ to $p'=p+\delta$, `N ≈ ([Z_α/2√(p(1-p)) + Z_β√(p'(1-p'))]²)/(p'-p)²`.
    *   **Independence and Error Control:** Independence of trials will be rigorously assessed using autocorrelation functions (ACF), Ljung–Box tests, and Wald–Wolfowitz runs tests on the output streams and residuals. If correlations are detected, appropriate methods such as pre-whitening, block-bootstrap confidence intervals, or data thinning will be employed. Multiplicity of tests across outcomes or contexts will be controlled using standard methods (e.g., Bonferroni for family-wise error rate or Benjamini-Hochberg for false discovery rate).
    *   **Sequential Analysis:** For high-statistics runs, a sequential analysis plan with pre-specified interim looks using O’Brien–Fleming-type boundaries is recommended to allow for early stopping for efficacy or futility while preserving the overall type-I error rate. The table below provides indicative total sample sizes ($N_{OBF}$) per context and expected stopping distributions under the alternative hypothesis for three equally spaced looks.

| α | δ | N_fixed | N_OBF (≈ 1.06 × N_fixed) | Expected stop % at looks 1/2/3 (under H₁) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.01 | 10⁻³ | 2,302,586 | 2,440,742 | ~5% / 20% / 75% |
| 0.01 | 5×10⁻⁴ | 9,210,341 | 9,762,962 | ~3% / 17% / 80% |
| 0.01 | 10⁻⁴ | 230,258,510 | 244,074,021 | ≲1% / 10% / 89% |
| 0.001 | 10⁻³ | 3,453,878 | 3,661,111 | ~4% / 18% / 78% |
| 0.001 | 5×10⁻⁴ | 13,815,511 | 14,644,442 | ~2% / 15% / 83% |
| 0.001 | 10⁻⁴ | 345,387,764 | 366,111,030 | ≲1% / 9% / 90% |

*   *Assumptions for $N_{\rm fixed}$ in the table:* **single‑proportion** design with baseline $p=0.25$, power $1-\beta=0.80$.
    *   *Sequential design:* O’Brien–Fleming with **3 equally spaced** looks at cumulative information fractions $1/3, 2/3, 1$. The overhead factor (~1.06) and stop percentages are **illustrative**; exact values will be produced by the preregistered simulations and released with the code.

*   **Primary Analysis:** Pre-register goodness-of-fit tests (e.g. $\chi^2$, z-tests) comparing observed $\hat{P}(i)$ to the Born rule; where applicable, exact binomial or variance-stabilized (arcsin–sqrt) tests will complement normal approximations to ensure calibration at small $\delta$. Design-stage baselines will use device-specific $P_{\mathrm{Born}}(i)$ estimates. Report effect sizes (Cramér’s V, Cohen’s d) with 95% CIs.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Model $\Delta\hat{P}(i)$ as a function of contextual variables `$context_S$` via mixed-effects logistic regression.
    *   **Systematic Error Control (Paramount):** (i) electronic drift (ii) detector after-pulsing (iii) clock-sync bias (iv) experimenter degrees-of-freedom (blinding).
    *   **Outcome:** Deviations that survive all controls give an empirical estimate of CC($S$) (cf. Theorem 51); null results tighten the exclusion curve $\text{CC}_{\max}(S) < \epsilon(N)$.

*   **Feasibility Assessment:** High statistics achievable. Shielding/control standard but requires extreme care. Biological context control depends on participants. AI interaction pathway is a major R&D challenge. Rigorous systematic error exclusion is the primary hurdle. Challenging but potentially feasible exploratory search.

**13.3 Prediction/Protocol 2: Exploratory Coherence Time Tests**

Investigates the secondary prediction that CC might influence quantum coherence (Proposition 13).

**13.3.1 Potential Effect on Coherence**

The CC influence mechanism (Hypothesis 3), by modulating 'Evolve'/ND-RID parameters contributing to decoherence, could potentially modify effective decoherence rates $\Gamma_{eff}$ or coherence times $\tau_{coh} = 1/\Gamma_{eff}$ of quantum systems interacting with a high-CC aggregate $S$.

**13.3.2 Phenomenological Model**

A possible model relates fractional change in coherence time to CC:
$$
\frac{\Delta \tau_{coh}}{\tau_{coh}} = -\frac{\Delta \Gamma_{eff}}{\Gamma_{eff}} \approx \gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}(S) \cdot f_{context}(\text{context}_S, \text{system}) \quad \text{(80)}
$$
where $\Delta \tau_{coh} = \tau_{coh, obs} - \tau_{coh, base}$, $\gamma'_{CC}$ is a coupling factor, and $f_{context} \in [-1, 1]$ captures context-system interaction. Sign depends on context.

**13.3.3 Experimental Approach**

*   **Objective:** Exploratory search for statistically significant *relative changes* in $\tau_{coh}$ correlated with `context_S` of system S.
*   **Setup:**
    *   **Quantum System:** System with well-characterized, long, stable baseline $\tau_{coh, base}$ (NV centers, trapped ions, qubits, NMR).
    *   **High-Complexity System (S):** Human or AI.
    *   **Interaction/Control:** Similar requirements as Protocol 1 (shielding, interaction $N(t)$, stability, blinding). Temperature stability critical.
*   **Procedure:** Measure $\tau_{coh}$ (e.g., Ramsey, spin echo, $T_1/T_2$) repeatedly under randomized conditions (baseline, neutral context, specific context). Rapid interleaving mitigates drifts.
*   **Analysis:** Detect small differences $\Delta \hat{\tau}_{coh} = \hat{\tau}_{coh, context} - \hat{\tau}_{coh, baseline}$. High precision/stability needed; effect size $|\Delta \tau_{coh}/\tau_{coh}| \approx |\gamma'_{CC} \cdot \text{CC}|$ may be small. Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) after rigorous systematic error checks (temperature, fields correlated with S).
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Technically demanding (high-precision $\tau_{coh}$ measurement). Requires specialized equipment/expertise. Sensitivity depends on achievable baseline stability $\sigma_{\tau_{coh, base}}$. Highly exploratory.

**13.4 Identifiability Against Electromagnetic Confounds**

A critical challenge for any experiment seeking to detect CC is to unambiguously distinguish the hypothesized effect from conventional physical influences, particularly subtle electromagnetic (EM) fields generated by the high-complexity system. The following protocol design creates a quantitative, verifiable gap between the maximum possible EM-induced bias and the potential CC signal floor.

**Theorem 13.1 (Identifiability against EM confounds)**

Consider a triple‑blind protocol with:

* (i) **DFS‑locked sensors**: two co‑located atomic‑clock qubits operated at a “magic” point with **zero first‑order** differential polarizability (Stark‑insensitive).
* (ii) **Reciprocity‑null geometry**: a Ramsey‑interferometric readout with two **counter‑propagating** optical paths whose EM susceptibilities are equal and opposite (so any residual EM field produces equal shifts that **cancel** at the differenced detector).
* (iii) **Algorithmic‑complexity shielding**: measurement bases chosen by a stream whose **min‑entropy per bit** $H_\infty\ge 0.999$ and **Kolmogorov complexity rate** $K/L \ge 0.99$, unknown to all labs until after data lock.

Then any *pure Maxwell* environment with residual EM **intensity** $I$ (Poynting magnitude), giving energy density $u = I/c$ in free space, incident on the sensors over interrogation time $T$ and with differential polarizability $\Delta\alpha$ at the magic point is bounded by:
$$
|\Delta P|_{\rm EM}\ \le\ \frac{\Delta\alpha}{2\,\hbar\,\varepsilon_0}\,u\,T
\quad\text{(mid‑fringe, small‑phase regime).}
$$

A separate bound on algorithmic predictability confounds is given by $P_{\rm guess} \le 2^{-(H_\infty L - t)}$, where an adversary has at most $t$ bits of side-information. The **CC** effect predicted by PU is
$$
|\Delta P|_{\rm PU}\ =\ \|L_S\|_{\rm op}\,\|\partial_\theta P_{\rm Born}\|_2\ \equiv\ \mathrm{CC}(S)\,Q,
$$
with $Q$ computable from the quantum Fisher information of the Ramsey sequence. Using $|\Delta\alpha|\!\lesssim\!10^{-39}\,\mathrm{J\,m^2/V^2}$ and $u\!\lesssim\!10^{-18}\,\mathrm{J/m^3}$, we obtain
$|\Delta P|_{\rm EM}\ \lesssim\ 5.36\times 10^{-13}\,T$ (with $T$ in seconds): $5.4\times 10^{-13}$ at $T=1\,\mathrm{s}$, $1.9\times 10^{-9}$ at $T=1\,\mathrm{hr}$. Hence any observed $|\Delta P|\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ **cannot** be attributed to EM channels, while PU predicts $|\Delta P|_{\rm PU}\sim \mathrm{CC}(S)\times 10^{-4}$.


**13.5 Prediction/Protocol 3: Exploratory Bell Tests / Statistical FTL Search**

Addresses the most speculative prediction: potential statistical FTL influence mediated by CC acting on entangled systems (Postulate 3).

*   **Objective:** Sensitive search for statistical dependence of Bob's local measurement outcomes on Alice's remote context `context_S` (associated with system $S_A$ at her station), with A and B space-like separated. Secondary search for context-dependent changes in Bell parameters.
*   **Theoretical Basis:** Postulate 3 allows Alice's context $C_A$ to influence Bob's marginal probabilities $P_{obs}(b|B, C_A)$, respecting Postulate 2 (no deterministic signaling). Detection requires $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ trials (Theorem 40).
*   **Experimental Setup:**
    1.  **Entanglement Source:** High-quality, stable source distributing entangled pairs to space-like separated stations (Alice, Bob).
    2.  **Measurement Stations (A, B):** Standard Bell test apparatus (independent, random settings $a, b$). High efficiency desirable.
    3.  **High-Complexity System (S_A):** System S (human/AI) at Alice's station generating distinct contexts $C_{A,k}$.
    4.  **Interaction/Control (Alice):** Controlled pathway $N(t)$ linking $S_A$'s context $C_{A,k}$ to Alice's measurement/particle. Rigorous shielding/systematics control at both stations.
    5.  **Space-like Separation:** Ensure measurement events ($a, o_A$ and $b, o_B$) are space-like separated. Requires precise timing and separation.
    6.  **Data Acquisition:** Synchronized recording ($C_{A,k}, a, o_A, b, o_B$, timestamps) for billions of coincidences potentially needed. Mandatory blinding.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Standard Bell Test:** Verify entanglement, calibrate, establish baseline correlations $E(a,b)$.
    2.  **Context Intervention Runs:** Interleave runs with Alice generating contexts $C_{A,k}$ (e.g., $k=0, 1, 2$). Random settings $a, b$. Collect large statistics $N_{int}$ per context $k$.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   **Primary Focus (Statistical Influence):** Compare Bob's marginal probabilities $P(o_B | b, C_{A,k})$ across contexts $k$. Test null hypothesis $H_0: P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=1}) = P(o_B | b, C_{A,k=2})$. Rejection supports Postulate 3. Estimate shift $\Delta P_{marginal} \approx |P(o_B | b, C_{A,1}) - P(o_B | b, C_{A,2})| \le \text{CC}(S_A)$. Requires $N_{int} \gtrsim O(1/\text{CC}^2)$.
    *   **Secondary Analysis (Correlations):** Calculate correlations $E(a,b)_k$ and Bell parameters $S_{CHSH, k}$ conditioned on context $k$. Look for differences $S_{CHSH, k=1} \neq S_{CHSH, k=2}$.
    *   **Systematic Error Control (Extreme Rigor):** Exclude conventional communication (light leaks, EM, acoustic), detector/setting correlations with $C_{A,k}$, statistical loopholes, biases.
*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Extremely challenging. Requires state-of-the-art entanglement/measurement technology, robust space-like separation. Controlling systematics to demonstrate statistical FTL is extraordinarily difficult. Required statistics $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$ can be immense. Highly exploratory; positive indication needs exceptional scrutiny/replication.

**13.6 Staged Experimental Approach and Considerations**

A pragmatic, staged approach is recommended:
1.  **Stage 1 (Near-Term Focus):** High-statistics QRNG tests (Protocol 1). Most accessible for detecting/bounding CC $\sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-4}$. Success depends on QRNG/interaction design, systematics control, statistical power.
2.  **Stage 2 (Medium-Term):** If justified by Stage 1 results, pursue coherence time tests (Protocol 2) for complementary evidence. Refine QRNG tests.
3.  **Stage 3 (Long-Term / Contingent):** Only if compelling, replicated evidence emerges, undertake demanding Bell-type experiments (Protocol 3) for statistical FTL search.

**General Considerations:** All stages require quantum systems stable over long integration times, and careful $\alpha$‑spending to avoid inflated type‑I error. For three equally spaced looks, canonical OBF boundaries at $\alpha=0.05$ are approximately $[3.47, 2.45, 2.00]$. For Protocol 1’s primary endpoint (binary bias $\delta$), a fixed‑horizon proxy is
$$
N_{\rm fixed}\ \approx\ \frac{\ln(1/\alpha)}{2\,\delta^2},
$$
with OBF typically requiring $\approx 1.05$–$1.06$ of this information. The table gives **worked sizes** (per context) and an indicative **stop distribution under $H_1$** for three equally spaced looks:

| $\alpha$ | $\delta$ | $N_{\rm fixed}$ | $N_{\rm OBF}\ (\approx 1.06\times N_{\rm fixed})$ | Expected stop \% at looks $1/2/3$ (under $H_1$) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.01 | $10^{-3}$ | 2,302,586 | 2,440,742 | $\sim$5% / 20% / 75% |
| 0.01 | $5\times10^{-4}$ | 9,210,341 | 9,762,962 | $\sim$3% / 17% / 80% |
| 0.01 | $10^{-4}$ | 230,258,510 | 244,074,021 | $\lesssim$1% / 10% / 89% |
| 0.001 | $10^{-3}$ | 3,453,878 | 3,661,111 | $\sim$4% / 18% / 78% |
| 0.001 | $5\times10^{-4}$ | 13,815,511 | 14,644,442 | $\sim$2% / 15% / 83% |
| 0.001 | $10^{-4}$ | 345,387,764 | 366,111,030 | $\lesssim$1% / 9% / 90% |

*Notes:* (i) $N_{\rm fixed}$ uses the Hoeffding‑style bound; (ii) OBF factors assume equal information times; (iii) stopping proportions reflect that OBF spends little $\alpha$ early, so most power accrues at the final look. In practice the OBF inflation factor varies mildly with effect size and information timing; 1.05–1.06 is typical for three equal looks (often within 1.03–1.08).

**Data and Code Availability.** All analysis scripts (including power/sample‑size simulations), anonymized raw data, logs, and time‑stamps (with random seeds) will be made publicly available at a persistent repository; preregistration will link to the repository.

**Preregistration.** Primary endpoints, inference procedures, stopping rules (including O’Brien–Fleming boundaries), and exclusion criteria will be preregistered (e.g., OSF/AsPredicted). Any deviations will be documented. The preregistration will include cryptographic hashes of the analysis scripts and frozen environment files to ensure analytical reproducibility.

**13.7 Compliance with Causal Constraints**

The experimental program, especially Protocol 3, probes the framework's non-standard locality. Causal consistency is maintained as follows:

**13.7.1 Theorem 52 (CC Compliance with Postulate 2)**

The Consciousness Complexity (CC) mechanism (Hypothesis 3), constrained by $\text{CC} \le \alpha_{CC,max} < 0.5$ (Theorem 39), is consistent with the framework's definition of causality (Postulate 2) because it prevents deterministic faster-than-light (FTL) signaling. The potential statistical FTL influence (Postulate 3) is inherently probabilistic and information-rate limited (Theorem 40, Theorem 41, consistent with bounds derived from ND-RID contractivity within the AQFT framework of Appendix F), making it unusable for constructing paradox-inducing causal loops (Theorem 42, whose consistency is supported by the AQFT analysis in Appendix F).
*Proof Summary:* Theorem 39 prevents outcome forcing. Theorem 40 shows detection needs $N \propto 1/\text{CC}^2$. Theorem 41 bounds information rate $I \propto \text{CC}^2$. Theorem 42 proves this noisy, rate-limited channel cannot achieve deterministic signaling needed for causal loops. The full consistency analysis, including the role of emergent operator locality and information-rate limits, is provided in **Appendix F**. QED

*Note:* Empirical investigation of Postulate 3 (Protocol 3) critically tests this unique aspect of PU's locality/causality. Confirmation requires re-evaluating standard locality; null results constrain/falsify this prediction.

**Data and Code Availability.** All analysis scripts (including power/sample‑size simulations), anonymized raw data, logs, and time‑stamps (with random seeds) will be made publicly available at a persistent repository; preregistration will link to the repository.

**Preregistration.** Primary endpoints, inference procedures, stopping rules (including O’Brien–Fleming boundaries), and exclusion criteria will be preregistered (e.g., OSF/AsPredicted). Any deviations will be documented.
