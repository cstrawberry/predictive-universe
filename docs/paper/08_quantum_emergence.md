# 8 Emergence of Quantum Mechanical Formalism

This section demonstrates that the standard mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics (QM) arises naturally and necessarily as the consistent effective description for the dynamics and state representation of Minimal Predictive Units (MPUs), as defined and constrained by the principles established in the preceding sections of the Predictive Universe (PU) framework. The core QM features—complex Hilbert spaces, superposition, the Born rule, uncertainty relations, entanglement, and Schrödinger evolution—are shown to emerge from the operational requirements of the MPU's adaptive predictive cycle (Definition 4), particularly the Dual Dynamics (Section 7.3.3) acting on the Perspectival State (Definition 24), under the fundamental limitations imposed by self-reference (SPAP, Theorem 10, Theorem 11) and reflexive interaction (ND-RID, Definition 6; Reflexivity Constraint, Theorem 33).

**8.1 QM Formalism as Effective Description**

The PU framework does not postulate QM but derives its structural elements as necessary consequences of optimizing prediction under logical and physical constraints. The following theorems formalize the deductive chain from the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) to the unique emergence of the complex Hilbert space formalism.

**Theorem 8.1 (PU–GNS Representation).**
Let $\mathfrak A$ be the *predictive observable algebra* generated by operational outcomes under ND‑RID and Evolve updates, with involution $^{\!*}$ and unit $\mathbf 1$. Assume $\mathfrak A$ is a C$^*$-algebra under the PCE-induced cost norm. Let $\omega:\mathfrak A\to\mathbb C$ be a *predictive state*, defined as a linear, positive, normalized, and continuous functional. Then, by the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) construction, there exist a Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\omega$, a \*‑representation $\pi_\omega:\mathfrak A\to\mathcal B(\mathcal H_\omega)$, and a cyclic vector $\psi_\omega\in\mathcal H_\omega$ such that $\omega(a)=\langle \psi_\omega,\ \pi_\omega(a)\ \psi_\omega\rangle$ for all $a\in\mathfrak A$.

**Theorem 8.2 (PCE Selection for Non-Contextuality at the PCE-Attractor).**
Assume the PCE objective takes the form $\mathcal J[\omega]=\mathcal R[\omega]+\lambda\,\mathcal C[\omega]$ with $\lambda>0$, where $\mathcal R$ is the context-blind predictive risk induced by ND-RID/Evolve and $\mathcal C$ is a nonnegative context-complexity functional satisfying (i) $\mathcal C[\omega]=0$ iff $\omega$ is non-contextual, (ii) $\mathcal C[\omega]>0$ whenever $\omega$ depends on the measurement context $\mathcal P$, and (iii) strict convexity in the degree of context dependence. Suppose further that the feasible set along the PCE dynamics contains a non-contextual representative achieving the same $\mathcal R$ as any contextual $\omega$ up to $o(1)$, and that the PCE Potential $V(x)$ is single-valued in the physical state. Then every global minimizer $\omega^\star$ of $\mathcal J$ is non-contextual, i.e., the PCE-Attractor (Definition 15a) admits an emergent effective description with state $x=\rho$ and $\omega^\star$ a frame function finitely additive on every orthogonal decomposition of the identity.

**Theorem 8.3 (Gleason–Busch Representation).**
Given that the predictive measure $\omega$ is a non-contextual frame function (by **Lemma G.1.1b**) and is continuous under the coarse-graining induced by the contractive ND-RID dynamics, there exists a unique density operator $\rho$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\omega$ such that: for $\dim \mathcal H_\omega \ge 3$, $\omega(P)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho P)$ for all projectors $P$; and for $\dim \mathcal H_\omega = 2$, $\omega(E)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho E)$ for all POVM effects $E$ (Busch extension under the full additivity required by PCE).

**Hypothesis 4 (PCE Selection for Complex Hilbert Spaces).**
Given a predictive system whose state space is a complete inner product space over a division ring $\mathbb{D} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}\}$, it is hypothesized that the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) uniquely selects the complex field $\mathbb{D} = \mathbb{C}$. This selection is driven by PCE's preference for the formalism with the optimal balance of descriptive power and resource efficiency. Real spaces lack the structure for efficient representation of all required symmetries (e.g., the $U(1)$ phase), while quaternionic spaces introduce higher complexity without a commensurate increase in predictive utility for the tasks governed by the Prediction Optimization Problem (POP).

**Theorem 8.5 (Schrödinger Dynamics from PCE and Time-Translation Symmetry).**
The Internal Prediction dynamics, being reversible, transition-probability preserving, and time-translation symmetric, are implemented by a family of unitary operators $\{U(t)\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$. Assuming the map $t \mapsto U(t)$ is weakly measurable (a minimal continuity requirement), it forms a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. By Stone’s theorem, this group has a self-adjoint generator $H$, leading directly to the Schrödinger equation $i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}|\psi\rangle=H|\psi\rangle$.

The complex Hilbert space structure (Proposition 4) thus provides the necessary mathematical framework for MPU dynamics. This structure is uniquely favored by the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) over alternatives (such as real or quaternionic vector spaces). As argued in Appendix G (Theorem G.1.8), the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is uniquely favored under PCE because it combines superior state-tomography efficiency with reduced symmetry-representation overhead, thereby maximizing predictive utility while minimizing resource costs. Alternative formalisms are demonstrably less resource-efficient under the framework's optimization principles. The Dual Dynamics (Section 7.3.3) dictate the evolution upon this stage, naturally mapping onto the core elements of QM formalism.

**8.2 Interpretation of Superposition**

**Proposition 6 (Interpretation of Superposition)**

Within the MPU framework, a superposition state $|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle_s$ in the MPU Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$ (Proposition 4), expressed relative to an orthonormal basis $\{|i\rangle_s\}$ corresponding to perspective $s \in \Sigma$ (Theorem 24), represents the MPU's predictive state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ in a situation where the outcome of the next 'Evolve' interaction (Definition 27) is fundamentally indeterminate (due to SPAP/RID limits, Theorem 27). The complex coefficients $c_i = \langle i | \psi \rangle_s$ encode the predictive information available from perspective $s$ about the potential outcome corresponding to state $|i\rangle_s$. The squared magnitude $|c_i|^2$ yields the probability of that outcome upon interaction (Proposition 7), while the relative phases between the coefficients $c_i$ determine the probabilities of outcomes relative to different, complementary perspectives (bases).
*Proof:*
1.  **Indeterminacy:** The outcome of 'Evolve' is fundamentally indeterminate (Theorem 27, Theorem 28). The pre-interaction state $S(t)$ cannot generally correspond to a single definite outcome state $|i\rangle_s$.
2.  **Hilbert Space Representation:** The state must encode the potentiality for multiple mutually exclusive outcomes $\{|i\rangle_s\}$. In the necessary Hilbert space structure $\mathcal{H}_0$ (Proposition 4), such a state is represented as a linear combination (superposition) $S(t) = |\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle_s$.
3.  **Information Encoding:** The coefficients $c_i$ carry predictive information. The Born rule (Proposition 7) links $|c_i|^2$ to probability. Relative phases encode information relevant for predictions in different bases (perspectives), enabling quantum interference.
4.  **Perspective Relativity:** The representation $\sum c_i |i\rangle_s$ depends on the chosen perspective $s$. The same state amplitude $S(t)=|\psi\rangle$ has different representations in different bases. Superposition is thus the necessary, perspective-dependent description of the MPU's state of predictive indeterminacy. QED

**8.3 Emergence of the Born Rule**

**Proposition 7 (Emergence of the Born Rule)**

The probability $P(i | S(t), s)$ for the 'Evolve' process (Definition 27), acting on an MPU with state amplitude $S(t)=|\psi\rangle$ relative to perspective $s$ (corresponding to ONB $\{|i\rangle_s\}$), is uniquely determined by the mathematical structure of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$ (Proposition 4) and fundamental consistency requirements (specifically, that probabilities for a complete set of outcomes must sum to unity independent of the choice of basis, **Theorem G.1.3** derived from PCE cost optimization in Appendix G.1) to be the Born rule:

$$
\sum_i |i\rangle_s \langle i|_s = I \quad \text{(49)}
$$

$$
P(i | S(t), s) = |\langle i | S(t) \rangle_s|^2 \quad \text{(50)}
$$

*Proof:* The derivation relies on the consistency of probability assignments within the emergent Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$ (Proposition 4), yielding the probability law first proposed by Born [Born 1926]. The following theorem makes this derivation rigorous.

**Theorem 8.6 (PU probability from PCE non‑contextual additivity).**
PCE motivates the non‑contextual additivity constraints; under these conditions, Gleason/Busch fix the quadratic (Born) form.

Assume:
(NC) **Context symmetry:** the predictive weight assigned to an effect $E$ depends only on $E$ (and not on which resolution $\{E_i\}$ it appears in).
(i) For any orthogonal family $\{E_i\}$ of effects with $\sum_i E_i=\mathbf 1$, the predictive weights satisfy additivity $\omega(\sum_i E_i)=\sum_i \omega(E_i)$.
(ii) Invariance under predictive refinements (PCE): if $E=\sum_j F_j$ is a refinement, $\omega(E)=\sum_j \omega(F_j)$, and $\omega$ is continuous under directed refinements.
Then for $\dim\mathcal H_\omega\ge3$, there exists a density operator $\rho$ such that [Gleason 1957; Busch 2003]

$$
\omega(E)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho E) \quad \text{for all effects }E.
$$

For qubits ($\dim\mathcal H_\omega=2$), the same holds provided additivity is imposed for all POVM refinements (a Busch-strength assumption [Busch 2003]).

*Proof.* Conditions (i)–(ii) define a normalized, non‑contextual frame functional on the lattice of projections; continuity under directed refinements extends it to effects. The classical argument by Gleason [Gleason 1957] for $\dim\ge3$ yields the trace form. For two‑dimensional systems, the extension by Busch [Busch 2003] utilizing POVM‑level additivity yields the same representation. ∎

This theorem formalizes the argument of Appendix G.1. The non‑contextuality and additivity premises follow from Lemma G.1.1b provided the PCE potential $V(x)$ is basis‑independent in the ND‑RID sense (single‑valued with a well‑defined gradient); otherwise (i)–(ii) should be taken as axioms. The Born rule probability assignment $P(i | S(t), s) = \text{Tr}(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \cdot |i\rangle_s\langle i|_s) = |\langle i | \psi \rangle_s|^2$ (Equation 50) therefore emerges as the unique measure reflecting the optimal allocation of predictive resources determined by the framework's foundational optimization principles. QED


**8.4 Derivation of Uncertainty Relations**

**Proposition 8 (Derivation of Uncertainty Relations)**

The Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relations for pairs of observables represented by Hermitian operators $\hat{A}, \hat{B}$ acting on the MPU Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$,
$$
\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2} |\langle [\hat{A}, \hat{B}] \rangle| \quad \text{(51)}
$$
(where $\Delta A = \sqrt{\langle (\hat{A} - \langle \hat{A} \rangle)^2 \rangle}$ is the standard deviation), emerge as a direct mathematical consequence of representing complementary aspects of the MPU state, whose simultaneous prediction is limited by SPAP (Corollary 1), by non-commuting operators within the Hilbert space formalism.

*Proof Summary:*
1.  **SPAP Implies Complementarity:** SPAP (Theorem 10, Theorem 11) establishes the impossibility of simultaneous perfect prediction for certain pairs of observables $A, B$ (Corollary 1).
2.  **Complementarity Implies Non-Commutation:** In the Hilbert space formalism (Proposition 4), observables correspond to Hermitian operators $\hat{A}, \hat{B}$. If $A$ and $B$ are complementary—meaning no state allows simultaneous perfect prediction of both—then $[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] \neq 0$. This follows because commuting Hermitian operators share a simultaneous eigenbasis (spectral theorem), and any such eigenstate would permit $\Delta A = \Delta B = 0$, contradicting complementarity.
3.  **Non-Commutation Implies Uncertainty:** For non-commuting operators, the Robertson inequality $\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$ follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied to the Hilbert space inner product [Robertson 1929].

The deeper unification of uncertainty with irreversibility—showing both arise from SPAP via channel contractivity—is developed in Section 14.2.5.

For emergent degrees of freedom corresponding to conjugate variables like position $\hat{x}$ and momentum $\hat{p}$, the structure of the underlying dynamics and symmetries leads via representation theory (e.g., Stone–von Neumann theorem) to the canonical commutation relation (CCR):
$$
[\hat{x},\hat{p}] = i\hbar \quad \text{(52)}
$$
Substituting this specific commutator into the general uncertainty relation (51) directly yields:
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{1}{2} |\langle [i\hbar] \rangle| = \frac{1}{2} |i\hbar| = \frac{\hbar}{2} \quad \text{(53)}
$$
Equation (53) is the familiar Heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and momentum. This illustrates how core QM structures, reflecting fundamental predictive limits imposed by SPAP and operationalized through the emergent Hilbert space formalism, arise naturally within the Predictive Universe framework.


**8.5 Explaining the Measurement Process and the 'Collapse' Phenomenon**

The PU framework explains quantum measurement, including the apparent wavefunction collapse, by identifying measurement as a specific instance of the universal 'Evolve' interaction dynamics, eliminating the need for a separate collapse postulate.

**8.5.1 Proposition 9 (Measurement Explained as 'Evolve' Instance)**

Quantum measurement of an observable $\hat{A}$ on a system $S$ (composed of MPUs) is explained within the PU framework as an instance of the universal stochastic 'Evolve' interaction (Definition 27) between system $S$ and the measurement apparatus (part of environment $N(t)_{app}$), whose formal steps are detailed in Appendix M (Section M.4). The apparatus configuration defines the interaction context, selecting perspective $s_{meas} \in \Sigma$ corresponding to the eigenbasis $\{|k\rangle\}$ of $\hat{A}$ (Theorem 24). 'Evolve' then unfolds according to Definition 27:

1.  **Probabilistic Amplitude Actualization:** The pre-measurement state $S(t)=|\psi\rangle$ actualizes to an eigenstate $|k\rangle$ of $\hat{A}$ with probability $P(k) = |\langle k | \psi \rangle|^2$ (Born rule, Equation 50).
2.  **Stochastic Perspective Shift:** Concurrently, the perspective index shifts stochastically $s \to s'_{meas(k)}$ according to the transition kernel $G(s' | s, k, N_{app})$ appropriate for the interaction and outcome $k$.

The post-measurement state is the specific, realized perspectival state $(|k\rangle, s'_{meas(k)})$, representing the definite outcome relative to the post-interaction perspective. The thermodynamic irreversibility of 'Evolve' ($\varepsilon > 0$, Theorem 31) accounts for measurement irreversibility.

*Proof:* This follows directly by applying the universal 'Evolve' dynamics (Definition 27) to a measurement interaction. The apparatus defines $N_{app}$ and $s_{meas}$ (eigenbasis of $\hat{A}$, Theorem 24). The two components of 'Evolve' yield the observed statistics and the transition to an eigenstate $|k\rangle$. The resulting perspectival state $(|k\rangle, s'_{meas(k)})$ correctly describes the system's definite outcome relative to the post-measurement context.

It is important to note that the 'Evolve' process described here is the universal mechanism for state actualization and perspective shift inherent in all MPU interactions. Given Postulate 1 (Section 7.1.2), which links the MPU's full operational cycle (including 'Evolve') to a minimal, elemental form of awareness, every such actualization event can be understood as fundamentally awareness-linked at the most basic operational level. The Consciousness Complexity (CC) hypothesis (detailed in Section 9) then proposes an additional layer where MPU aggregates exhibiting higher operational complexity (and thus, by extension of Postulate 1, potentially more sophisticated forms of awareness) can subtly bias the probabilistic outcomes of these fundamental, elementally awareness-linked 'Evolve' events. Thus, while the 'Evolve' process (underpinned by the minimal MPU operational awareness) provides the general solution to the measurement problem by replacing the collapse postulate, CC describes a potential modification to the *specific probabilities* governing that process when systems of greater conscious complexity are contextually involved. QED

**8.5.2 Example 8.1 (Qubit Measurement Illustration)**

Consider an MPU qubit in perspectival state $S_{(s_{initial})}(t) = (|\psi\rangle, s_{initial})$, with $|\psi\rangle = c_0|0\rangle + c_1|1\rangle$ (Z-basis).

*   **Z-Basis Measurement:** Apparatus selects perspective $s_Z$ (Z-basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$). 'Evolve' triggers:
    *   *Actualization:* Outcome is $|0\rangle$ with $P(0)=|c_0|^2$ or $|1\rangle$ with $P(1)=|c_1|^2$. Assume outcome $|0\rangle$.
    *   *Shift:* Perspective shifts $s_{initial} \to s'_{Z,0}$.
    *   *Post-Measurement State:* $S'_{Z,0} = (|0\rangle, s'_{Z,0})$. System described by $|0\rangle$ relative to $s'_{Z,0}$.

*   **X-Basis Measurement:** Apparatus selects perspective $s_X$ (X-basis $\{|+\rangle, |-\rangle\}$). 'Evolve' triggers:
    *   *Actualization:* Outcome is $|+\rangle$ with $P(+)=|\langle +|\psi\rangle|^2 = |(c_0+c_1)/\sqrt{2}|^2$ or $|-\rangle$ with $P(-)=|\langle -|\psi\rangle|^2 = |(c_0-c_1)/\sqrt{2}|^2$. Assume outcome $|+\rangle$.
    *   *Shift:* Perspective shifts $s_{initial} \to s'_{X,+}$.
    *   *Post-Measurement State:* $S'_{X,+} = (|+\rangle, s'_{X,+})$. System described by $|+\rangle$ relative to $s'_{X,+}$.

*   **Relative Actuality:** The outcome $|0\rangle$ is actual relative to perspective $s'_{Z,0}$. From the incompatible perspective $s'_{X,+}$, state $|0\rangle$ remains a superposition. There is no absolute collapsed state; actuality is relative to the post-interaction perspective, consistent with causality constraints (Section 10).

**8.5.3 Corollary 4 (Potential Resolution of Measurement Problem)**

The explanation of measurement as perspectival actualization via 'Evolve' (Proposition 9) potentially resolves the measurement problem:
1.  **Provides Mechanism:** Offers a physical mechanism ('Evolve', Definition 27) for state actualization, replacing the collapse postulate.
2.  **Grounds Probabilities:** Grounds Born rule probabilities (Proposition 7) in fundamental Logical Indeterminacy (Hypothesis 2).
3.  **Definite Outcomes:** Explains definite outcomes via probabilistic actualization relative to the interaction perspective. Decoherence arises naturally from frequent environmental 'Evolve' interactions.
4.  **Universality:** 'Evolve' is universal, removing the need for special observers or a Heisenberg cut. Actuality is perspectival but objective within frame, consistent with causality (Section 10).

By unifying dynamics and providing a physical grounding for outcomes, the PU framework offers a potential resolution consistent with its foundational principles.

**8.6 Interpretation of Entanglement (Proposition 10)**

Quantum entanglement finds a natural interpretation within the MPU framework as a representation of strong predictive coupling between interacting units.

**Proposition 10 (Interpretation of Entanglement as Predictive Coupling)**

Quantum entanglement between multiple MPUs (e.g., A and B) is interpreted within the PU framework as a composite state $S_{AB}(t)$ in the tensor product Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$ that encodes maximal predictive coupling. This coupling manifests as strong correlations, exceeding classical limits, between the outcomes of local 'Evolve' interactions performed on individual MPUs. Entangled states maximize mutual information $I(A;B)$ relative to individual entropies. Consistency with causality (Section 10) is maintained.
*Proof:*
1.  **Composite State:** State $S_{AB}(t)$ resides in $\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$, representing combined predictive possibilities.
2.  **Predictive Coupling via Mutual Information:** $I(A;B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB})$ quantifies correlation.
3.  **Entanglement Maximizes Mutual Information:** Entangled states allow higher $I(A;B)$ than separable states for given subsystem mixedness. Maximally entangled pure states achieve $I(A;B) = 2 S(\rho_A)$.
4.  **Correlations via Joint 'Evolve':** Local 'Evolve' outcomes are governed by applying the Born rule to the joint state $S_{AB}(t)$ relative to local perspectives $s_A, s_B$. Entanglement structure enforces strong correlations $P(o_A, o_B | S_{AB}, s_A, s_B)$.
5.  **Local Randomness, Global Correlation:** Local outcomes $o_A, o_B$ are individually random (Theorem 27, Theorem 28), but their joint probabilities reflect correlations in $S_{AB}(t)$.
6.  **No Deterministic Signaling:** Correlations arise from shared state established by past interactions, not instantaneous influence (proven consistent with causality in Theorem 39, Theorem 42).
7.  **Conclusion:** Entanglement represents maximal predictive coupling allowed between interacting MPUs within the emergent Hilbert space formalism. QED

**Corollary 5 (Non-Locality as Manifestation of Coupling Strength)**

Apparent non-local correlations (e.g., Bell inequality violations) manifest the strong predictive coupling encoded in the entangled state $S_{AB}(t)$. These correlations are enforced statistically by local 'Evolve' dynamics acting on subsystems, respecting shared contextual information in the joint state, without requiring superluminal causal influence (deterministic signaling).
*Proof:* Bell violations demonstrate correlations beyond local hidden variables. PU encodes these strong correlations in $S_{AB}(t)$. A local 'Evolve' on A yields random outcome $o_A$, updating predictive information about B instantaneously (due to shared state). Subsequent local 'Evolve' on B yields $o_B$, locally random but statistically correlated with $o_A$. The non-local appearance stems from interpreting the globally defined state during local, stochastic 'Evolve' events. This respects operational causality (Postulate 2, Theorem 42) and is analyzed further in Section 10. QED

**8.7 Derivation of Schrödinger Equation (Proposition 11)**

The deterministic evolution of the MPU state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ between 'Evolve' interactions, representing internal prediction ($b_p$, Definition 26), is necessarily described by the Schrödinger equation.

**Proposition 11 (Derivation of Schrödinger Equation for Internal Evolution)**

The time evolution of the MPU state amplitude $S(t) \in \mathcal{H}_0$ during the Internal Prediction phase (Definition 26) is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This emerges as a necessary consequence of fundamental symmetries and the principle of efficient information processing.

**Theorem 8.7 (Time-translation symmetry ⇒ unitary group ⇒ Schrödinger dynamics).**
Assume the PCE-optimal evolution preserves Born statistics and is time-translation symmetric: there exists a family $\{\mathcal T_t\}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ with $\mathcal T_{t+s}=\mathcal T_t\circ\mathcal T_s$, $\mathcal T_0=\mathrm{id}$, continuous in $t$, and preserving all transition probabilities [Bargmann 1964]. Then there exists a strongly continuous unitary group $U(t)$ with $\mathcal T_t(\rho)=U(t)\rho U(t)^\dagger$. By Stone’s theorem, $U(t)=e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}$ for a (densely defined) self-adjoint operator $\hat{H}$ [Stone 1932], so
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\rho(t)=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat{H},\rho(t)],\qquad i\hbar\,\frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle=\hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle.
$$

*Proof and Physical Justification:* The premises of Theorem 8.7 are not postulates but are derived from the PU framework's core principles.
1.  **Preservation of Born Statistics (Unitarity):** The Internal Prediction phase models deterministic evolution between irreversible 'Evolve' events. The Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) favors dynamics that preserve predictive information with minimal cost. For a system described on a Hilbert space, information-preserving, reversible, and probability-conserving evolution is necessarily unitary. This requirement aligns with the premises of Wigner's theorem [Bargmann 1964], which guarantees that the evolution is implemented by a unitary operator (anti-unitary operators are excluded by the requirement of continuity).
2.  **Time-Translation Symmetry:** The assumption of a continuous, time-translation invariant evolution implies that the unitary operators form a strongly continuous one-parameter group $\{U(t)\}$.
3.  **Existence of Generator:** Stone's theorem [Stone 1932] then guarantees the existence of a unique, self-adjoint generator for this group, the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$.
4.  **Physical Identification of the Hamiltonian:** The abstract generator $\hat{H}$ is given a concrete physical meaning by the framework. As established in **Theorem 29**, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\langle\hat{H}\rangle$, corresponds to the MPU's baseline operational energy cost, which is determined by the physical resource cost rate $R(C_{op})$.
5.  **Schrödinger Equation:** The differential form of the evolution, the Schrödinger equation (Equation 43), follows directly from differentiating the exponential form $U(t) = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}$.

Thus, the Schrödinger equation emerges as the unique description of dynamics that are consistent with the symmetries of continuous time and the PCE-driven requirement for efficient, information-preserving predictive processing, with its generator physically grounded in the MPU's operational resource cost.
