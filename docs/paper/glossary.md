Key values: $K(3) = 12$, $K(4) = 24$ (24-cell), $K(8) = 240$ (E$_8$). The mode-channel correspondence (Theorem Z.10) requires $M_{\rm int} = K(D)$ at equilibrium, uniquely selecting $D = 4$ since $K(4) = M = 24$.

*   **Landauer Pointer:** (Appendix Z, Theorem Z.1, Section Z.2.3) The minimal physical subsystem instantiating the irreducible cost $\varepsilon = \ln 2$ of the SPAP cycle. Dimension determined by PPI + Shannon entropy: $a = e^\varepsilon = 2$. Represents the two-level active kernel within the $d_0 = 8$ MPU Hilbert space where baseline predictive activity concentrates.

*   **Leech Lattice ($\Lambda_{24}$):** (Appendix R, Section R.4.2) The unique optimal sphere-packing lattice in 24 dimensions (Cohn et al. 2017), with kissing number 196,560 and minimum norm 4 (rootless).

*   **Law of Prediction:** (Theorem 19, Equation 22) The functional relationship between invested complexity $C$, target complexity $\hat{C}_{target}$, and achievable Predictive Performance $PP$ within the viable range $(\alpha, \beta)$: $PP(C, \hat{C}_{target}) = \beta - (\beta-\alpha) \exp[-\kappa_{eff} (C-C_{op})/\hat{C}_{target}]$.

*   **Logical Indeterminacy:** (Definition 12) The fundamental, in-principle unpredictability arising directly from the logical structure of self-reference (SPAP) and reflexive interaction (RID/RU) in systems possessing sufficient computational richness (Property R).

Independent of width parameter $\xi$, Hessian constants $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$, and overall normalization. Restricted to discrete values $\mathcal{R} \in \{4/3, 3/2, 2, 3, 4\}$ by E$_8$ geometry. Charged lepton sector shows $\mathcal{R}_\ell^{\rm obs} \approx 2.889$, consistent with $\mathcal{R} = 3$ to 3.8%.

*   **Mode-Channel Correspondence:** (Appendix Z, Theorem Z.10) The PCE equilibrium condition requiring internal QFI modes to match external spatial channels: $M_{\rm int} = M_{\rm phys}$. At thermodynamic equilibrium with isotropic environment, $M_{\rm phys} = K(D)$ (kissing number). Combined with $M_{\rm int} = 2ab = 24$, this uniquely selects $D = 4$ as the emergent spacetime dimension.

The system's adaptation dynamics are modeled as a stochastic gradient flow seeking to minimize $V(x)$.  

*   **Perspectival Realism:** (Section 14.2) Philosophical stance suggested by the framework where reality has definite properties, but their description and actualization (via 'Evolve') are inherently relative to the interaction context or perspective $s \in \Sigma$.

*   **Perspectival State ($S_{(s)}(t)$):** (Definition 24, Appendix M) The complete state of an MPU, represented by the pair $(S(t), s)$, where $S(t)=|\psi(t)\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_0$ is the state amplitude and $s \in \Sigma$ is the perspective index representing the interaction context/basis.


*   **PCE-Attractor Orbit:** (Theorem Z.6.3a) The orbit of the PCE-Attractor state $\rho_0 = \frac{1}{a}I_a \oplus 0_b$ under unitary conjugation is $\mathcal{O}_{\rho_0} \cong U(d_0)/(U(a) \times U(b)) \cong \text{Gr}(2,8)$, a compact Hermitian symmetric space of complex dimension $ab = 12$ and real dimension $2ab = 24 = M$. This identification provides an independent geometric derivation of the interface mode count.

Establishes the Standard Model gauge algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3) \oplus \mathfrak{su}(2) \oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$ as the unique 12-dimensional solution (Corollary G.8.4c), providing complementary verification of Proposition G.M1.

Arises from off-diagonal QFI contributions connecting active ($a = 2$) and inactive ($b = 6$) subspaces. Over-determined by 8 independent mathematical constraints (Theorem Z.12).

*   **RU (Reflexive Undecidability):** (**Theorem 12, Theorems A.2.3, A.2.4**) Fundamental limitation on the ability of an interacting algorithm to reliably decide certain properties of systems governed by RID, due to the interaction perturbing the system state.

*   **Reflexivity Constraint:** (Theorem 33, Equation 48) Fundamental trade-off $\Delta I \cdot (\Delta S_{min}/k_B) \ge \kappa_r > 0$ between relevant information gain $\Delta I$ in an 'Evolve' interaction and the minimum necessary dimensionless state disturbance (entropy production) $\Delta S_{min}/k_B$. Arises from $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$.

*   **Regularity:** (Definition C.3) Geometric Regularity of the MPU network, encompassing uniform volume growth and bounded curvature. Necessary condition for viability (Theorem 43).

*   **$R_I(C)$:** (Definition 3b, Equation 5) Reflexive-Information Cost function. *Informational* overhead rate associated with self-referential verification/processing. $R_I(C) = (r_I/\ln 2) \ln(C/K_0)$ for $C > K_0$.

*   **$|\psi(t)\rangle$:** (Definition 24) State amplitude component of the Perspectival State, represented by the Hilbert space vector $|\psi(t)\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_0$.

*   **$S_{(s)}(t)$:** (Definition 24) The complete Perspectival State $(S(t), s) = (|\psi(t)\rangle, s)$ of an MPU.

*   **Space of Becoming:** (Definition 8) The open interval $(\alpha, \beta)$, representing the necessary operational range for Predictive Performance $PP(t)$ for viable, adaptive MPU functioning (Axiom 3).

*   **SPAP (Self-Referential Paradox of Accurate Prediction):** (**Section 4.2, Theorems 10, 11, A.1.1, A.1.3**) Theorems demonstrating the logical impossibility of guaranteed perfect self-prediction (deterministic or probabilistic) for systems possessing sufficient computational richness (Property R). Establishes fundamental Logical Indeterminacy and performance limit $\alpha_{SPAP}$.

*   **Statistical FTL Influence:** (Postulate 3, Section 10.3) Hypothesized effect where CC modulation by Alice can statistically influence the marginal probabilities of outcomes for Bob's measurements on an entangled system at a space-like separated location, argued to be consistent with operational causality (Postulate 2) due to information limits (Theorem 42, Appendix F).

*   **24-Cell:** (Appendix Z, Definition Z.8) The unique regular convex 4-polytope with 24 vertices, forming the optimal kissing configuration $K(4) = 24$ in 4 dimensions. Self-dual and tiles $\mathbb{R}^4$. Equivalent to the minimal vectors of the $D_4$ root lattice after normalization.

*   **$\mathcal{T}$ (Simulation Horizon/Steps):** (Used in Theorems 14, B.2) Dimensionless number of steps or cycles over which a SPAP-limited prediction task is performed or a simulation is run.

*   **$T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ (MPU Stress-Energy Tensor):** (Definition B.8, Equation B.15, Appendix B) Macroscopic, symmetric, covariantly conserved stress-energy tensor derived from coarse-grained average of the underlying microscopic operator $\hat{\Theta}_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ (Definition B.7), representing MPU activity and costs ($\hat{H}_v, \hat{R}, \hat{R}_I, \hat{V}_{vv'}$). Source term in the emergent Einstein Field Equations (EFE, Equation 76).

*   **Theorem 43 (Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity):** (Section 11.3.1–11.3.2, Theorem C.6, Appendix D) Theorem asserting POP/PCE dynamics necessarily drive MPU networks to self-organize into configurations exhibiting large-scale geometric regularity (Definition C.3). Justified by necessity arguments (Appendix C) and dynamical convergence (Appendix D). Foundational for emergence of smooth spacetime.

*   **UCT (Unified Cost of Transgression):** (Appendix N) The thermodynamic/operational cost functional that quantifies the resource penalty for attempts to surpass the Prediction Coherence Boundary; unifies predictive and relativistic limits.

*   **$u^*$ (Bare Coupling):** (Appendix Z, Theorem Z.7) The information-theoretic interaction strength at the PCE-Attractor, determined by capacity saturation: $u^* = d_0^{1/M} - 1 = 8^{1/24} - 1 = 2^{1/8} - 1 \approx 0.09051$. Related to fine-structure constant via Predictive Ward Identity: $\alpha_{\rm em} = u^*/(4\pi\kappa_{\rm eff})$, yielding $\alpha^{-1} ≈ 137.036 \pm 0.0001$ at Thomson limit.
