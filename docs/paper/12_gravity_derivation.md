# 12 Emergence of Gravitational Dynamics from Predictive Thermodynamics

This section derives the dynamical equations governing the emergent spacetime geometry $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, whose existence and properties were established conditionally in Section 11. The derivation follows the thermodynamic approach pioneered by Jacobson \[Jacobson 1995], interpreting Einstein's Field Equations as an equation of state for the spacetime manifold derived from the Clausius relation ($\delta Q = T \delta S$). Within the PU framework, this approach is grounded in the thermodynamic properties of the underlying MPU network interactions, specifically the information limits associated with Non-Deterministic Reflexive Interaction Dynamics (ND‑RID) across causal boundaries, which lead to the Horizon Entropy Area Law (Theorem 49) derived in Appendix E. By applying the Clausius relation to infinitesimal causal horizons and relating heat flow to the MPU stress-energy tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$, Appendix B), we demonstrate that local thermodynamic consistency necessitates the Einstein Field Equations. We work in natural units where $c=\hbar=k_{B}=1$ unless explicitly stated otherwise, and adopt a spacetime signature convention $(-,+,+,+)$. **Assumptions (brief):** (i) local causal horizons admit thermodynamic variables $(T,\delta S)$; (ii) entropy density is proportional to area (area law) up to an $O(1)$ coefficient fixed by low-energy consistency; (iii) matter flux is encoded by an effective stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}$; (iv) near-horizon expansions allow neglect of shear/twist at $\lambda=0$; (v) local Lorentz invariance holds for the effective dynamics.

**12.1 Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Horizon Properties**

We consider the thermodynamic properties associated with local causal horizons within the emergent spacetime. We adopt standard tensor conventions $R^\rho{}*{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial*\mu \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma} - \dots$ and $R_{\mu\nu} = R^\alpha{}_{\mu\alpha\nu}$.

**12.1.1 Definition 38 (Def 38): Local Causal Horizon**

At any arbitrary point $p$ in the emergent spacetime manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, consider an infinitesimal spacelike 2-surface element $\delta S$. The null hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ generated by the congruence of null geodesics $k^\mu = (d/d\lambda)^\mu$ originating orthogonally from $\delta S$ defines a local causal horizon. $\lambda$ is an affine parameter chosen such that $k^\mu \nabla_\mu \lambda = 1$ by definition, and $\lambda=0$ at $p$. This horizon acts as a boundary separating regions that are causally inaccessible from each other. For an observer momentarily co-accelerating with a frame where the horizon appears locally like a Rindler horizon, we can define:

* **Surface gravity** $\kappa$.
* Approximate boost Killing vector $\xi^\mu \approx \kappa \lambda k^\mu$ near the bifurcation surface $\lambda=0$ (with $\lambda$ increasing into the wedge).

These local horizons provide the setting for applying thermodynamic reasoning to the underlying MPU network information exchange.

**12.1.2 Postulate 4 (Post 4): Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium**

We postulate that the emergent macroscopic description of the MPU network, within the spacetime manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, admits states that can be considered to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with respect to transformations generated by the approximate Killing vector $\xi^\mu$ near any local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$. This implies that standard thermodynamic concepts—specifically temperature $T$ and heat flow $\delta Q$—can be meaningfully defined and related for observers near such horizons.

*Justification:* This assumption, common in thermodynamic derivations of gravity, is supported within PU by the argument that POP/PCE optimization drives the MPU network towards statistically stable macroscopic states maximizing entropy under constraints near causal boundaries (local MaxEnt principle), as deviations from LTE incur efficiency penalties disfavored by the dynamics minimizing the PCE potential $V(x)$ (Appendix D).

**12.1.3 Definition 39 (Def 39): Horizon Heat Flux $\delta Q$**

The **heat flux $\delta Q_{in}$** flowing into the local Rindler wedge across an infinitesimal patch $\delta\mathcal{H}$ of the local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ (spanned by area element $dA$ and affine parameter range $d\lambda$, with $\lambda \ge 0$ increasing into the wedge) is defined as the boost-energy flow across the patch, measured by the local accelerating observer via the flux of the macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)}$ (Appendix B). Using the area 3-vector $d\Sigma^\beta = k^\beta dA d\lambda$ and the approximate Killing vector $\xi^{\alpha} \approx \kappa \lambda k^{\alpha}$:

$$
\delta Q_{in} = \int_{\delta\mathcal{H}} T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} \xi^{\alpha} d\Sigma^{\beta} = \int_{\lambda=0}^{\lambda_{max}} \!\!\! \int_{dA} T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} (\kappa \lambda k^{\alpha}) (k^{\beta} dA d\lambda)
$$

$$
\delta Q_{in} = \int_{\lambda=0}^{\lambda_{max}} \!\!\! \kappa\lambda \left( \int_{dA} T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} k^{\alpha} k^{\beta} dA \right) d\lambda
\quad \text{(68)}
$$

Here $\lambda$ increases toward the Rindler wedge, so $\delta Q_{in} > 0$ for positive energy flux $T_{\alpha\beta}k^{\alpha}k^{\beta}$.

**12.1.4 Definition 40 (Def 40): Horizon Temperature $T$**

Consistent with local thermodynamic equilibrium (Postulate 4) and analogous to the Unruh effect, the effective temperature $T$ associated with the local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ is defined in terms of the surface gravity $\kappa$. In SI units: $T = \hbar \kappa / (2\pi k_B c)$. In natural units ($c=\hbar=k_B=1$):

$$
T = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi} \quad \text{(natural units)} \quad \text{(69)}
$$

Within PU, this temperature reflects the effective thermal noise spectrum encountered by MPUs near the horizon, ultimately related to the information limits ($\varepsilon, f_{RID}$) of the underlying ND-RID processes.

**12.2 The Horizon Entropy Area Law**

A crucial ingredient is the relationship between the entropy associated with a causal horizon and its area, derived from the fundamental information limits of ND-RID interactions.

**12.2.1 Theorem 49 (Horizon-Entropy Area Law)**

**Conditional on the Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity (Theorem 43)**, the equilibrium boundary entropy $S_{boundary}$ associated with the MPU degrees of freedom constituting or crossing a causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ is proportional to the horizon's cross-sectional area $\mathcal{A}$. This arises because the finite classical information capacity $C_{max}(f_{RID}) < \ln d_0$ (Theorem E.2) of the fundamental ND-RID channels mediating information transfer across the boundary limits the maximum distinguishable information. Assuming this bound is saturated at equilibrium—saturation is expected because any unsaturated boundary would allow PCE-driven adaptation to increase entropy until the limit is reached—the relationship takes the universal Bekenstein-Hawking form, $S = k_B c^3 \mathcal{A} / (4 G \hbar)$ in SI units. With Planck length $L_P^2 = G\hbar/c^3$, this is $S = k_B \mathcal{A} / (4 L_P^2)$. In natural units ($c=\hbar=k_B=1$, $L_P^2=G$):

$$
S_{boundary}(\mathcal{A}) = \frac{\mathcal{A}}{4 G} \quad \text{(natural units)} \quad \text{(70)}
$$

An infinitesimal change $\delta \mathcal{A}$ in area corresponds to:

$$
\delta S = \frac{1}{4 G} \delta \mathcal{A} \quad \text{(natural units)} \quad \text{(71)}
$$

*Proof Summary:* The derivation, detailed comprehensively in **Appendix E**, hinges on the fundamental information limits imposed by ND-RID interactions across causal boundaries within the emergent geometry. The core logic proceeds as follows: (1) The inherent irreversibility of the 'Evolve' process, quantified by the minimum cost $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$ (Theorem 31, rigorously derived in Appendix J), implies strict contractivity ($f_{RID}<1$) of the average ND-RID channel (Lemma E.1). (2) This contractivity fundamentally bounds the classical information capacity of each individual MPU interaction channel ($C_{max}(f_{RID}) < \ln d_0$, Theorem E.2), limiting the maximum distinguishable information transmissible per channel. (3) Conditional on the necessary emergence of geometric regularity (Theorem 43), the number of effective independent information channels ($N_{links}$) crossing a horizon boundary scales linearly with its area $\mathcal{A}$ in the macroscopic limit ($N_{links} = \sigma_{link} \mathcal{A}$, Theorem E.3). (4) The total equilibrium boundary entropy $S_{boundary}$ associated with the boundary is the product of the number of channels and the maximum entropy per channel ($S_{boundary} = N_{links} \times S_{channel}^{max} = N_{links} \times C_{max}$), directly yielding the linear scaling $S_{boundary} = (\sigma_{link} C_{max}) \mathcal{A}$ (Equation E.6). Identifying the coefficient with the Bekenstein-Hawking value $1/(4 G)$ recovers the standard Area Law form (Equation 70) and crucially links the emergent gravitational constant $G$ to the underlying microscopic MPU parameters (spacing $\delta$ via $\sigma_{link}$, and ND-RID efficiency via $C_{max}$) as shown in Equation (E.9) and Equation (E.10).

**12.3 Thermodynamic Derivation of Einstein's Field Equations**

We combine the local thermodynamic relations (Postulate 4, Definition 39, Definition 40) with the derived entropy-area law (Theorem 49) and apply the fundamental Clausius relation ($\delta Q = T \delta S$) to an infinitesimal patch of a local causal horizon. The following theorem formalizes this derivation, following the logic of Jacobson (1995).

**Theorem 12.G2 (Local Clausius relation for all null generators ⇒ EFE).**
Let $(M,g)$ be the emergent Lorentzian manifold of Section 11 with local Rindler horizons generated by null $k^\mu$ (affinely parameterized by $\lambda$) and Unruh temperature $T=\kappa/2\pi$. Assume:
(a) **Area law** $\delta S=\eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}$ for horizon entropy (Appendix E), with $\eta=1/(4G)$.  
(b) **Energy flux** $\delta Q=\int T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}\,\chi^\mu d\Sigma^\nu$ through the horizon (to first order in $\lambda$, with $\kappa$ the surface gravity).  
(c) **Raychaudhuri (linearized)** with **vanishing initial expansion and shear**: $\theta(0)=\sigma(0)=0$ and $\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda}=-R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu+O(\lambda)$.  
(d) **Local equilibrium / near‑equilibrium** so that higher‑order corrections are negligible on the horizon slice: $\delta S=\eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}+O(\lambda^2)$, $\delta Q=T\,\delta S+O(\lambda^2)$.  
If the **Clausius relation** holds for all such $k^\mu$, $\delta Q=T\,\delta S$ (to linear order in $\lambda$), then

$$
R_{\mu\nu}-\tfrac12 R g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}
=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\,T^{(MPU)}_{\mu\nu},
$$

with $\Lambda$ an integration constant fixed by the vacuum sector.

*Proof.* Linearizing Raychaudhuri with $\theta(0)=\sigma(0)=0$ gives $\delta A \propto -\int R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu \lambda, d\lambda, dA$. Meanwhile $\delta Q\propto \int T_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu \lambda, d\lambda, dA$. Equating $\delta Q=T\delta S$ for all $k^\mu$ yields the key energy-focusing relation:

$$
T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} k^{\alpha} k^{\beta} = \frac{1}{8\pi G} \left(-\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda}\right)
\quad \text{(72)}
$$

Substituting the Raychaudhuri equation,

$$
\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = -R_{\alpha\beta}k^\alpha k^\beta - \frac{1}{2}\theta^2 - \sigma_{\alpha\beta}\sigma^{\alpha\beta} + \omega_{\alpha\beta}\omega^{\alpha\beta},
\quad \text{(73)}
$$

and evaluating at $\lambda=0$ where $\theta=\sigma=\omega=0$, gives:

$$
\left( R_{\alpha\beta} - 8\pi G T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} \right) k^{\alpha} k^{\beta} = 0.
\quad \text{(74)}
$$

Since this must hold for all null $k^\mu$, the tensor in parentheses must be proportional to the metric:

$$
R_{\alpha\beta} - 8\pi G T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} = f(x) g_{\alpha\beta}.
\quad \text{(75)}
$$

Taking the divergence and using $\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0$ plus the Bianchi identity gives $f(x)=-\tfrac12 R+\Lambda$, which yields the Einstein equation stated. ∎

### 12.3.1 Theorem 50 (Einstein Field Equations)

The requirement of local thermodynamic consistency, as formalized in Theorem 12.G2, necessitates that the emergent spacetime geometry $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$ and the emergent macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ are related by Einstein's Field Equations (EFE) (restoring $c$):

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}
\quad \text{(76)}
$$

where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $G$ is the emergent gravitational constant (Equation E.9), $c$ is the invariant speed (Theorem 46), and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ is the stress-energy tensor derived from the underlying MPU network activity (Appendix B).
*Proof:* The result follows directly from Theorem 12.G2. QED

**Uniqueness Lemma 12.1 (Uniqueness of Einstein Tensor).**
In four dimensions, the only generally covariant, symmetric, divergence-free rank-2 tensor field derivable from a Lagrangian containing at most second derivatives of $g_{\mu\nu}$, and consistent with the emergent Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density fixed by PU principles (Appendix E), is the Einstein tensor plus a cosmological term: $\mathcal E_{\mu\nu}=G_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}$.
*Proof Summary:* Lovelock's theorem \[Lovelock 1971] limits second-order covariant gravitational actions in D=4 to the Einstein-Hilbert term plus $\Lambda$. Higher-curvature terms generally modify the Wald entropy formula, deviating from the Bekenstein-Hawking form derived from ND-RID limits (Appendix E). Consistency with the framework's emergent thermodynamics selects the unique EFE structure (Equation 76). QED

**12.4 Interpretation: Gravity as Predictive Thermodynamics**

Within the Predictive Universe framework, gravity emerges as a macroscopic thermodynamic phenomenon. Einstein's Field Equations (Equation 76) represent the equation of state ensuring local thermodynamic consistency between the emergent spacetime geometry and the underlying MPU network's predictive activity. The curvature of spacetime reflects the geometric adjustments needed to satisfy the Clausius relation on all local causal horizons, given the Horizon Entropy Area Law (Theorem 49) which arises from fundamental information limits ($\varepsilon, f_{RID}$) of reflexive MPU interactions (ND‑RID). The distribution of predictive activity ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$)—which itself quantifies the coarse-grained density and flux of the very resource costs that are optimized by the predictive network—dictates local information capacity of boundaries (Area Law), and geometry ($g_{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}$) adapts via EFE to maintain local thermodynamic equilibrium.
Gravity is the large-scale thermodynamic consequence of the universe's underlying predictive processing and its inherent informational limits.


### **12.5 Scale-Dependent Gravity and Effective Dark Matter (Summary of Appendix I)**

A significant implication, detailed in Appendix I, is that the effective gravitational coupling $G$ (given by Equation E.9) can become scale-dependent. The effect arises because the equilibrium MPU parameters ($\delta$, $C_{\max}$) are fixed by PCE optimisation and therefore vary with environment. Appendix I shows that in sparse, large-scale regions the system reaches complexity saturation sooner (Corollary I.2), which relaxes the network parameters ($\delta(R)$ grows while $C_{\max}(R)$ falls for $R>L_0$, Section I.5). Inserting these scale-dependent parameters into Equation E.9 produces a running Newton constant $G(R)$ (Equation I.4) that increases at large $R$. In the weak-field limit this is equivalent to an effective dark-matter density $\rho_{\mathrm{DM,eff}}(R) = [G(R)/G_0 - 1]\rho_b(R)$ (Equation I.6) that automatically tracks the baryonic distribution. Full derivation: Appendix I, Equations (I.4)–(I.6).

**Theorem (Universality at fixed scale).** For the predictive action $S_{\mathrm{PU}}(g,\Phi) = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{geom}}(g) + \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MPU}}(g,\Phi)\right)$ with diffeomorphism invariance and no background structures, the Noether identity implies $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ with
$$
T^{\mu\nu} := -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta S_\mathrm{MPU}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}.
$$
In the test‑body limit of a sharply localized distribution, the worldline $x^\mu(\tau)$ extremizes $\int d\tau$ and satisfies
$$
\frac{D^2 x^\mu}{D\tau^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau}=0,
$$
so all matter follows metric geodesics and the weak/Einstein equivalence principles hold.

**Corollary (Universality of $G$ at a coarse‑graining scale).** At a fixed coarse‑graining scale $\mu$, the area‑law coefficient $1/(4G(\mu))$ appearing in the Clausius derivation of EFE and in the Newtonian limit from geodesic motion is the **same $G(\mu)$**, enforcing universal gravitational coupling at that scale. Slow scale‑dependence $G(\mu)$ is discussed in Appendix I and §12.5.
