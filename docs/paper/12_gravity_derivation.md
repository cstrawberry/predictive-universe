# 12 Emergence of Gravitational Dynamics from Predictive Thermodynamics

This section derives the dynamical equations governing the emergent spacetime geometry $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, whose existence and properties were established conditionally in Section 11. The derivation follows the thermodynamic approach pioneered by Jacobson [Jacobson 1995], interpreting Einstein's Field Equations as an equation of state for the spacetime manifold derived from the Clausius relation ($\delta Q = T \delta S$). Within the PU framework, this approach is grounded in the thermodynamic properties of the underlying MPU network interactions. Specifically, the information limits of Non-Deterministic Reflexive Interaction Dynamics (ND‑RID) give rise to the **Horizon Entropy Area Law (Theorem 49)**, which is rigorously derived in **Appendix E**. By applying the Clausius relation to infinitesimal causal horizons and relating heat flow to the **MPU stress-energy tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$)**, constructed in **Appendix B**, we demonstrate that local thermodynamic consistency necessitates the Einstein Field Equations. We work in natural units where $c=\hbar=k_{B}=1$ unless explicitly stated otherwise, and adopt a spacetime signature convention of $(-,+,+,+)$.

Under the following explicit premises, which are themselves derived results or foundational postulates of the PU framework, we derive the macroscopic dynamics:

*   (A1) **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium:** The MPU network admits coarse-grained states treatable as being in local thermodynamic equilibrium near causal horizons (**Postulate 4**).
*   (A2) **Horizon Thermodynamics:** Local horizons possess an Unruh temperature $T=\kappa/(2\pi)$ (Equation 69) and an entropy density given by the **Area Law derived from ND-RID information limits in Appendix E**.
*   (A3) **Geometric Regularity:** The MPU network dynamically converges to a configuration that ensures a smooth manifold limit with controlled curvature, as justified by necessity (**Appendix C**) and dynamical stability (**Appendix D**).
*   (A4) **Conserved Energy-Momentum Source:** A covariantly conserved effective stress–energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{MPU})}$ emerges from the underlying MPU dynamics, with $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ (**Appendix B**).
*   (A5) **Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI):** The emergent dynamics are locally Lorentz invariant, a direct consequence of the causal structure derived from MPU interactions (**Theorem 46**).

Under these premises, applying the Clausius relation $\delta Q = T\,\delta S$ to local Rindler horizons, with heat flux $\delta Q > 0$ defined as energy flow into the causal diamond, and combining it with the Raychaudhuri equation, yields Einstein’s field equations (**Theorem 50**).

**12.1 Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Horizon Properties**

We consider the thermodynamic properties associated with local causal horizons within the emergent spacetime. We adopt standard tensor conventions $$R^{\rho}{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu \Gamma^{\rho}_{\nu\sigma} - \partial_\nu \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\sigma} + \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\sigma} - \Gamma^{\rho}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\sigma}$$ and $R_{\mu\nu} = R^\alpha{}_{\mu\alpha\nu}$.

**12.1.1 Definition 38 (Def 38): Local Causal Horizon**

At any arbitrary point $p$ in the emergent spacetime manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, consider an infinitesimal spacelike 2-surface element $\mathcal{P}$. The null hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ generated by the congruence of future-directed null geodesics, with tangent vectors $k^\mu = (d/d\lambda)^\mu$ originating orthogonally from $\mathcal{P}$, defines a local causal horizon. $\lambda$ is an affine parameter with $\lambda=0$ at $\mathcal{P}$. This horizon acts as a boundary separating regions that are causally inaccessible from each other. For an observer momentarily co-accelerating with a frame where the horizon appears locally like a Rindler horizon, we can define:

* **Surface gravity** $\kappa$.
* Approximate boost Killing vector $\xi^\mu \approx -\,\kappa\,\lambda\,k^\mu$ near the bifurcation surface $\lambda=0$ (with affine parameter chosen so that $k^\mu$ is future-directed and $\lambda<0$ on the horizon portion to the past of $p$, so $\xi^\mu$ is future-directed on the relevant horizon patch).

These local horizons provide the setting for applying thermodynamic reasoning to the underlying MPU network information exchange.

**12.1.2 Postulate 4 (Post 4): Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium**

We postulate that the emergent macroscopic description of the MPU network, within the spacetime manifold $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$, admits states that can be considered to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with respect to transformations generated by the approximate Killing vector $\xi^\mu$ near any local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$. This implies that standard thermodynamic concepts—specifically temperature $T$ and heat flow $\delta Q$—can be meaningfully defined and related for observers near such horizons.

*Justification:* This assumption, common in thermodynamic derivations of gravity, is supported within PU by the argument that POP/PCE optimization drives the MPU network towards statistically stable macroscopic states maximizing entropy under constraints near causal boundaries (local MaxEnt principle), as deviations from LTE incur efficiency penalties disfavored by the dynamics minimizing the PCE potential $V(x)$ (Appendix D).

**12.1.3 Definition 39 (Def 39): Horizon Heat Flux $\delta Q$**

The **heat flux $\delta Q$** flowing across an infinitesimal patch $\delta\mathcal{H}$ of the local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ (spanned by area element $dA$ and affine parameter range $d\lambda$) is defined as the boost-energy flow across the patch, measured by the local accelerating observer via the flux of the macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)}$ (Appendix B). Using the horizon area element $d\Sigma^\beta = k^\beta\, dA\, d\lambda$ and the approximate Killing vector $\xi^{\alpha} \approx -\,\kappa\,\lambda\,k^{\alpha}$ (with $\lambda<0$ on the portion of the horizon to the past of $p$):

$$
\delta Q
= \int_{\delta\mathcal{H}} T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)}\, \xi^{\alpha}\, d\Sigma^{\beta}
= \int \!\! \int_{dA}
T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)}\, \big(-\kappa \lambda\, k^{\alpha}\big)\, \big(k^{\beta}\, dA\, d\lambda\big).
$$

$$
\delta Q = - \int \kappa\lambda \left( \int_{dA} T_{\alpha\beta}^{(MPU)} k^{\alpha} k^{\beta} dA \right) d\lambda
\quad \text{(68)}
$$

The integration is understood over a small horizon segment $\lambda\in[\lambda_0,0]$ with $\lambda_0<0$, so that $-\kappa\lambda\ge 0$ on the integration domain and $\delta Q$ is positive for positive energy flux into the causally disconnected region. Here, $\delta Q$ represents the energy flux crossing the horizon into the region causally disconnected from the observer.

**12.1.4 Definition 40 (Def 40): Horizon Temperature $T$**

Consistent with local thermodynamic equilibrium (Postulate 4) and analogous to the Unruh effect, the effective temperature $T$ associated with the local causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ is defined in terms of the surface gravity $\kappa$. In SI units: $T = \hbar \kappa / (2\pi k_B c)$. In natural units ($c=\hbar=k_B=1$):

$$
T = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi} \quad \text{(69)}
$$


Within PU, this temperature reflects the effective thermal noise spectrum encountered by MPUs near the horizon, ultimately related to the information limits ($\varepsilon, f_{RID}$) of the underlying ND-RID processes.

**12.2 The Horizon Entropy Area Law**

A crucial ingredient is the relationship between the entropy associated with a causal horizon and its area, derived from the fundamental information limits of ND-RID interactions.

**12.2.1 Theorem 49 (Horizon-Entropy Area Law)**

**Conditional on the Necessary Emergence of Geometric Regularity (Theorem 43)**, the equilibrium boundary entropy $S_{boundary}$ associated with the MPU degrees of freedom constituting or crossing a causal horizon $\mathcal{H}$ is proportional to the horizon's cross-sectional area $\mathcal{A}$. This arises because the per-channel reliable classical information capacity is bounded by the residual MPU information budget, $C_{\max}(f_{RID}) \le \ln(d_0)-\varepsilon < \ln(d_0)$ (Appendix E, Theorem E.2; Equation E.15), with $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$ (Theorem 31). Assuming this bound is saturated at equilibrium—saturation is expected as a consequence of PCE driving the system towards maximum entropy states consistent with the constraints (local MaxEnt principle)—the relationship takes the universal Bekenstein-Hawking form, $S = k_B c^3 \mathcal{A} / (4 G \hbar)$ in SI units. With Planck length $L_P^2 = G\hbar/c^3$, this is $S = k_B \mathcal{A} / (4 L_P^2)$. In natural units ($c=\hbar=k_B=1$, $L_P^2=G$):

$$
S_{boundary}(\mathcal{A}) = \frac{\mathcal{A}}{4 G} \quad \text{(70)}
$$

An infinitesimal change $\delta \mathcal{A}$ in area corresponds to:

$$
\delta S = \frac{1}{4 G} \delta \mathcal{A} \quad \text{(71)}
$$

*Proof Summary:* Appendix E derives an operational Area Law from ND-RID information limits (finite per-channel capacity) together with geometric scaling of the number of effective independent boundary channels. Entanglement-area discussion is optional context rather than an independent proof input.

**12.3 Thermodynamic Derivation of Einstein's Field Equations**

We combine the local thermodynamic relations (Postulate 4, Definition 39, Definition 40) with the derived entropy-area law (Theorem 49) and apply the fundamental Clausius relation ($\delta Q = T \delta S$) to an infinitesimal patch of a local causal horizon. The following theorem formalizes this derivation, following the logic of Jacobson (1995).

**Theorem 12.1 (Local Clausius relation for all null generators ⇒ EFE).**
Let $(M,g)$ be the emergent Lorentzian manifold of Section 11 with local Rindler horizons generated by null $k^\mu$ (affinely parameterized by $\lambda$) and Unruh temperature $T=\kappa/2\pi$. Assume:
(a) **Area law** $\delta S=\eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}$ for horizon entropy (Appendix E). The coefficient $\eta$ is identified with $1/(4G)$, where $G$ is defined via the micro–macro calibration in Appendix E (Equation E.7), matching $\eta$ to the universal Bekenstein–Hawking coefficient $1/4$.
(b) **Energy flux** $\delta Q=\int T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}\,\xi^\mu d\Sigma^\nu$ through the horizon (to first order in $\lambda$, with $\kappa$ the surface gravity).  
(c) **Raychaudhuri (linearized)** with **vanishing initial expansion and shear**: $\theta(0)=\sigma(0)=0$ and $\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda}=-R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu+O(\lambda)$.  
(d) **Local equilibrium / near‑equilibrium** so that higher‑order corrections are negligible on the horizon slice: $\delta S=\eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}+O(\lambda^2)$, $\delta Q=T\,\delta S+O(\lambda^2)$.  
If the **Clausius relation** holds for all such $k^\mu$, $\delta Q=T\,\delta S$ (to linear order in $\lambda$), then

$$
R_{\mu\nu}-\tfrac12 R g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}
=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\,T^{(MPU)}_{\mu\nu},
$$

with $\Lambda$ an integration constant fixed by the vacuum sector.

*Proof.* Fix $p$ and a future-directed null vector $k^\mu$ at $p$, and consider the associated local Rindler horizon $\mathcal{H}$ generated by the congruence tangent to $k^\mu$. Let $\lambda$ be an affine parameter along generators with $\lambda=0$ at $p$, and let $d\Sigma^\nu = k^\nu\,d\lambda\,dA$ be the horizon area element.

**Step 1 (Heat flux).** Using the approximate boost Killing vector $\xi^\mu\approx -\kappa\lambda\,k^\mu$ near $p$ (Definition 38), the energy flux through $\mathcal{H}$ is
$$
\delta Q
=\int_\mathcal{H} T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}\,\xi^\mu\,d\Sigma^\nu
=
-\kappa\int T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}\,k^\mu k^\nu\,\lambda\,d\lambda\,dA.
\quad \text{(72)}
$$

**Step 2 (Area change from curvature).** The Raychaudhuri equation for the null congruence is
$$
\frac{d\theta}{d\lambda}
=
-\frac{1}{2}\theta^2-\sigma_{\alpha\beta}\sigma^{\alpha\beta}-R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu.
\quad \text{(73)}
$$
By local equilibrium, $\theta(0)=0$ and $\sigma_{\alpha\beta}(0)=0$, hence to leading order
$$
\theta(\lambda)= -\lambda\,R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu + O(\lambda^2).
$$
Since $d(\delta\mathcal{A})/d\lambda = \theta\,dA$, integrating gives
$$
\delta\mathcal{A}
=
-\int R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu\,\lambda\,d\lambda\,dA
+O(\lambda^2).
\quad \text{(74)}
$$

**Step 3 (Clausius relation).** Using $T=\kappa/(2\pi)$ (Equation 69) and the area-law input $\delta S=\eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}$, the Clausius relation $\delta Q=T\,\delta S$ becomes, after substituting (72) and (74) and canceling the common factor $-\kappa\int\lambda\,d\lambda\,dA$,
$$
T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}k^\mu k^\nu
=
\frac{\eta}{2\pi}\,R_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu.
\quad \text{(75)}
$$
Holding for all null $k^\mu$ implies
$$
R_{\mu\nu}+\Phi g_{\mu\nu}=\frac{2\pi}{\eta}\,T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}
$$
for some scalar $\Phi$. Taking the divergence, using $\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}=0$ and the contracted Bianchi identity, yields $\Phi=-\tfrac12 R+\Lambda$ for some constant $\Lambda$. Therefore
$$
R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}
=
\frac{2\pi}{\eta}\,T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}.
$$
Defining $8\pi G:=2\pi/\eta$ (equivalently $G=1/(4\eta)$) gives the stated Einstein field equations. $\square$

### 12.3.1 Theorem 50 (Einstein Field Equations)

The requirement of local thermodynamic consistency, as formalized in Theorem 12.1, necessitates that the emergent spacetime geometry $(M, g_{\mu\nu})$ and the emergent macroscopic MPU stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ are related by Einstein's Field Equations (EFE) (restoring $c$):

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}
\quad \text{(76)}
$$

where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $G$ is the emergent gravitational constant (Equation E.9), $c$ is the invariant speed (Theorem 46), and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$ is the stress-energy tensor derived from the underlying MPU network activity (Appendix B).

*Proof:* The result follows directly from Theorem 12.1. Crucially, this derivation does not assume the Einstein field equations, does not assume a pre-existing horizon entropy formula, and does not assume the value of $G$—all three emerge from local thermodynamic consistency applied to the entanglement structure established in Appendix E. QED

**Uniqueness Lemma 12.1 (Uniqueness of Einstein Tensor).**
In four dimensions, the only generally covariant, symmetric, divergence-free rank-2 tensor field derivable from a Lagrangian containing at most second derivatives of $g_{\mu\nu}$, and consistent with the emergent Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density fixed by PU principles (Appendix E), is the Einstein tensor plus a cosmological term: $\mathcal E_{\mu\nu}=G_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}$.
*Proof Summary:* Lovelock's theorem [Lovelock 1971] limits second-order covariant gravitational actions in D=4 to the Einstein-Hilbert term plus $\Lambda$. Higher-curvature terms generally modify the Wald entropy formula, deviating from the Bekenstein-Hawking form derived from ND-RID limits (Appendix E). Consistency with the framework's emergent thermodynamics selects the unique EFE structure (Equation 76). QED

## 12.4 Interpretation: Gravity as Predictive Thermodynamics

Within the Predictive Universe framework, gravity emerges as a macroscopic thermodynamic phenomenon.

### 12.4.1 Thermodynamic Structure Across Scales

*In this subsection, natural units $\hbar = c = k_B = 1$ are used in Parts A and B; SI units are restored in Part C and the table.*

The derivation of Einstein's equations (Theorem 12.1) applies the Clausius relation $\delta Q = T\,\delta S$ to local Rindler horizons. This thermodynamic structure connects to analogous equilibration processes at other scales.

**Theorem 12.2 (Scale-Dependent Thermodynamic Equilibration).** *Thermodynamic equilibration under ND-RID dynamics yields characteristic structures at different scales:*

| Scale | Equilibration Process | Physical Result | Reference |
|:------|:----------------------|:----------------|:----------|
| Microscopic (MPU) | KMS equilibrium under modular flow | Born rule probabilities | Theorem G.1.9.2 |
| Macroscopic (Rindler) | Clausius relation on local horizons | Einstein field equations | Theorem 12.1 |
| Cosmological (de Sitter) | Instanton tunneling with PCE selection | Cosmological constant | Appendix U |

*Proof.*

**Part A (Microscopic).** From Theorem G.1.9.2, PCE optimization drives ND-RID channels toward detailed balance. The KMS condition (Theorem G.1.9.5) characterizes equilibrium as Gibbs states $\rho^* = Z^{-1}e^{-K^*}$. For the modular Hamiltonian $K^* = -\ln\rho_{phys}$, the resulting probabilities are $p_i = \mathrm{tr}(\rho_{phys} P_i)$—the Born rule. This represents equilibration at the single-MPU scale.

**Part B (Macroscopic).** From Theorem 12.1, applying the Clausius relation to local Rindler horizons with Unruh temperature $T = \kappa/(2\pi)$, area-law entropy $\delta S = \eta \delta\mathcal{A}$, and energy flux $\delta Q = \int T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}\,\xi^\mu d\Sigma^\nu$, combined with the Raychaudhuri equation, yields:
$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}
$$
The coefficient $\eta$ appearing in $\delta S = \eta\,\delta\mathcal{A}$ is related to the gravitational coupling by $\eta=1/(4G)$ in the standard normalization (Theorem E.5).

**Part C (Cosmological).** The de Sitter horizon at $r_\Lambda = \sqrt{3/\Lambda}$ has Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{dS} = (\hbar c/2\pi k_B)\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$ [Gibbons & Hawking 1977]. The instanton tunneling rate $\Gamma \propto e^{-2\kappa}$ with $\kappa = 141.5$ determines the vacuum energy density (Appendix U, Theorem U.16). ∎

**Remark 12.2.1: Common Origin.** The ND-RID channel structure that produces Born rule probabilities (via capacity bound $C_{\max} < \ln d_0$, Theorem E.2) also determines $G$ via Equation E.9:
$$
G = \frac{\eta\delta^2 c^3}{4\hbar\chi C_{\max}(f_{RID})}
$$
Both quantum measurement statistics and gravitational dynamics are constrained by the information-theoretic limits of reflexive prediction. Einstein's Field Equations (Equation 76) represent the equation of state ensuring local thermodynamic consistency between the emergent spacetime geometry and the underlying MPU network's predictive activity. The factor $1/4$ enters through the standard normalization relating horizon entropy density to the coupling in the Einstein equation; PU's nontrivial content is the operational evaluation of the entropy density from channel counting (Appendix E). PCE optimization of the vacuum state yields $C_{\max}^* = \ln(d_0) - \varepsilon = 2\ln 2$, predicting the MPU-to-Planck scale ratio $\delta/L_P \approx \sqrt{8\ln 2} \approx 2.355$ (Equation E.16). The curvature of spacetime reflects the geometric adjustments needed to satisfy the Clausius relation on all local causal horizons, given the Horizon Entropy Area Law (Theorem 49) which arises from fundamental information limits ($\varepsilon, f_{RID}$) of reflexive MPU interactions (ND‑RID). The distribution of predictive activity ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(MPU)}$)—which itself quantifies the coarse-grained density and flux of the very resource costs that are optimized by the predictive network—dictates local information capacity of boundaries (Area Law), and geometry ($g_{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}$) adapts via EFE to maintain local thermodynamic equilibrium.
Gravity is the large-scale thermodynamic consequence of the universe's underlying predictive processing and its inherent informational limits.


### **12.5 A Multi-Scale, Environment-Dependent Model for Emergent Gravity**

The Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE) dictates that the mechanism for emergent gravity must be globally self-consistent and resource-optimal. As detailed in Appendix I, this leads to a multi-scale, environment-dependent solution for the phenomena attributed to dark matter.

*   **At Galactic Scales:** In environments with moderate potential wells, PCE favors a low-cost "Law Modification." This manifests as a scale-dependent effective Newton constant, $G(R)$ (Equation I.4). This naturally explains galaxy rotation curves and baryonic scaling relations **as an environment‑dependent relaxation that does not alter the homogeneous early‑Universe limit**.

*   **At Cluster Scales:** In the deep potential wells of clusters, a large change in $G$ is ruled out by global cosmological constraints (e.g., from the CMB). PCE therefore selects a different, globally-consistent mechanism: a "Source Modification." This manifests as a non-local "predictive matter" response (Equation I.7), a collective reconfiguration of the MPU substrate that contributes to the stress-energy tensor only in these extreme environments.

This two-tiered model provides a unified explanation for dark matter phenomenology across scales, rooted in the adaptive dynamics of the underlying predictive substrate, while remaining consistent with cosmological observations. The efficiency factor $\eta' = 3/(8\sqrt{3}) \approx 0.2165$ is rigorously derived from PU constants via the QFI linear-response bridge law (Appendix H, Definition H.0), yielding the prediction $g_0 = \eta' c^2\sqrt{\Lambda/3} \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$—agreeing with the empirical galactic acceleration scale to within 2% with no fitted parameters.

**Theorem 12.3 (Universality at fixed scale).** For the predictive action $S_{\mathrm{PU}}(g,\Phi) = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{geom}}(g) + \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MPU}}(g,\Phi)\right)$ with diffeomorphism invariance and no background structures, the Noether identity implies $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ with
$$
T^{\mu\nu} := -\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta S_\mathrm{MPU}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}.
$$
In the test‑body limit of a sharply localized distribution, the worldline $x^\mu(\tau)$ extremizes $\int d\tau$ and satisfies
$$
\frac{D^2 x^\mu}{D\tau^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau}=0,
$$
so all matter follows metric geodesics and the weak/Einstein equivalence principles hold.

**Corollary 12.3.1 (Universality of $G$ at a coarse‑graining scale).** At a fixed coarse‑graining scale $\mu$, the area‑law coefficient $1/(4G(\mu))$ appearing in the Clausius derivation of EFE and in the Newtonian limit from geodesic motion is the **same $G(\mu)$**, enforcing universal gravitational coupling at that scale. Slow scale‑dependence $G(\mu)$ is discussed in Appendix I and §12.5.
