## Derivation of the Bekenstein–Hawking Area Law from a SPAP-Incorporating Holographic Code

**Abstract**

We propose a derivation pathway for the Bekenstein–Hawking Area Law [Bekenstein 1973; Hawking 1975] within the Predictive Universe (PU) framework, utilizing a quantum error-correcting code (QECC) implemented via a hyperbolic tensor network. This SPAP-QECC lattice occupies a (3+1)-dimensional bulk, with spatial slices tiled hyperbolically. Crucially, each bulk tensor incorporates the irreducible $k_B \ln 2$ entropy generation step associated with the logical state merging inherent in the Self-Prediction / Anti-Prediction (SPAP) cycle (derived in PU Appendix J). Analyzing the geometric scaling relating bulk node density to boundary area, we introduce the Capacity-Erasure Balance Hypothesis (Hypothesis 5.1), which posits that the classical capacity of the emergent boundary channel (limited by PU's ND-RID dynamics) must match the information erasure rate density originating from the bulk SPAP events for thermodynamic consistency. Conditional on this hypothesis, the existence of a suitable erasure-tolerant SPAP-QECC (Assumption 2.2) [Pastawski et al. 2015], and idealized geometric factors (Assumption 6.1), we demonstrate that the total entropy associated with the boundary scales linearly with its area $\mathcal{A}$, precisely reproducing the Bekenstein–Hawking formula $S_{\text{BH}} = k_B \mathcal{A} / (4 L_P^2)$, including the factor of $1/4$. This provides a candidate microscopic origin for gravitational entropy rooted in fundamental logical irreversibility and holographic information processing [Susskind 1995; 't Hooft 1993], contingent on the specified hypotheses.

**1. Geometry of the Hyperbolic Tiling**

We model a constant-time spatial slice of the bulk spacetime using a regular tiling $\{p,q,r\}$ of 3D hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$. The fundamental lattice scale (edge length) $\ell$ is identified with the characteristic MPU spacing $\delta$ emerging from the PCE optimization (Appendix D).

**Definition 1.1 (Bulk Region and Boundary).** Let $R$ be a connected region within the hyperbolic tiling, composed of $N(R)$ fundamental cells (nodes). Its boundary $\partial R$ is a closed 2D surface whose area is $\mathcal{A}$. The area is discretized into units of $\sim \ell^2$ associated with boundary links or plaquettes.

**Lemma 1.2 (Bulk Node Density Relative to Boundary Area).** For large regions ($\mathcal{A}/\ell^2 \to \infty$), the number of bulk nodes $N(R)$ whose causal future or past intersects the boundary region $\partial R$ (or lie within the entanglement wedge associated with $\partial R$ [Ryu & Takayanagi 2006]) scales linearly with the boundary area $\mathcal{A}$. The constant of proportionality defines the dimensionless geometric density factor $c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)}$:
$$
N(R) = c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \frac{\mathcal{A}}{\ell^2} + o(\mathcal{A}/\ell^2) \quad (1.1)
$$
The value $c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)}$ is an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant determined purely by the hyperbolic geometry $\{p,q,r\}$ and the specific bulk-boundary correspondence adopted (e.g., minimal surfaces defining entanglement wedges). Its existence relies on the area-law scaling of entanglement entropy or causal connections in such geometries [Bombelli et al. 1986; Srednicki 1993].



**2. The SPAP-QECC Lattice**

We hypothesize that the emergent bulk dynamics can be effectively modeled by a tensor network [Orús 2014] where each tensor incorporates the fundamental logical irreversibility of the SPAP cycle.

**Definition 2.1 (SPAP-Incorporating Tensor).** A tensor $T$ associated with a bulk node (cell) is SPAP-Incorporating if its action as a quantum channel includes:
(i) Unitary evolution corresponding to the reversible logic of the SPAP cycle acting on a dedicated internal subspace (dimension $\ge 2^{K_0}=8$, corresponding to $K_0=3$ bits).
(ii) A deterministic trace-out (partial trace) operation over the effective ancilla degree(s) of freedom within this subspace, representing the irreversible erasure required for cyclic operation (corresponding to the $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$ cost derived in PU Appendix J).
(iii) Standard unitary evolution or identity maps on other input/output legs, consistent with propagating quantum information through the network.

**Assumption 2.2 (SPAP-QECC Existence and Properties).** We assume that a tensor network constructed from SPAP-Incorporating Tensors, tiled according to the hyperbolic geometry $\{p,q,r\}$, can form a valid Quantum Error-Correcting Code (QECC) [Nielsen & Chuang 2010, Ch. 10]. Specifically, this **SPAP-QECC** must possess holographic properties:
(i) Logical information encoded deep within the bulk region $R$ can be decoded or reconstructed by operators acting solely on the boundary region $\partial R$.
(ii) The code is tolerant to the continuous, local erasure of the SPAP ancilla degrees of freedom occurring at every node in the bulk [Grassl et al. 1997].
*Justification Note:* While constructing such codes explicitly is complex, the general existence of holographic QECCs (like the HaPPY code [Pastawski et al. 2015]) and codes tolerant to erasure noise is established in quantum information theory. We assume here that the PU framework, driven by PCE optimization which favors robust information processing, leads to emergent structures with these necessary QECC properties. The continuous SPAP erasure represents a specific, structured noise model that the emergent code must handle.



**3. Entropy Generation from SPAP Erasure**

The irreversible step defined within the SPAP-Incorporating Tensor has direct thermodynamic consequences.

**Lemma 3.1 (Minimal Erasure Entropy).** Each local application of the SPAP-Incorporating tensor at a bulk node, specifically the erasure of the ancilla degree(s) of freedom required by the SPAP cycle logic, generates a minimal thermodynamic entropy $S_{\text{erase}}$ given by Landauer's principle [Landauer 1961] applied to the inherent 2-to-1 logical state merging. As rigorously derived in PU Appendix J (Theorem J.1):
$$
S_{\text{erase}} = k_B \ln 2 \quad (3.1)
$$
This entropy represents dissipated heat or information transferred to inaccessible degrees of freedom (the environment, or outgoing radiation modes from the node) [Bennett 1973].

**(Computational Verification)**
The provided Python code simulates the SPAP channel (unitary logic + ancilla reset) acting on a maximally mixed 3-qubit state. The calculation verifies that the von Neumann entropy decreases by exactly 1 bit (i.e., $\ln 2$ nats), confirming the expected information loss and associated Landauer cost for this minimal erasure process.
```python
"""
Apply the SPAP node channel (reversible logic + ancilla reset) to a maximally
mixed 3-qubit state and show that the von-Neumann entropy decreases by exactly
one bit – the Landauer cost of erasing one qubit.

**4. Total Boundary Entropy Flux Calculation**

The entropy continuously generated within the bulk region $R$ must effectively flow across or be accounted for by the degrees of freedom at the boundary $\partial R$.

**Proposition 4.1 (Total Thermodynamic Entropy Flux).** Assuming the entropy $S_{\text{erase}}$ generated at each bulk node within region $R$ effectively contributes to the entropy budget associated with the boundary $\partial R$, the total thermodynamic entropy $S_{therm}$ associated with the boundary area $\mathcal{A}$ scales as:
$$
S_{therm}(\mathcal{A}) = N(R) \times S_{\text{erase}} = \left( c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \frac{\mathcal{A}}{\ell^2} \right) k_B \ln 2 \quad (4.1)
$$
The entropy per unit area is therefore:
$$
\frac{S_{therm}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{A}} = \frac{k_B c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \ln 2}{\ell^2} \quad (4.2)
$$
*Proof.* Follows directly by multiplying the number of relevant bulk nodes $N(R)$ from Lemma 1.2 by the entropy generation per node $S_{\text{erase}}$ from Lemma 3.1. This represents the total rate density of entropy generation behind the boundary that needs to be balanced or accounted for by the boundary dynamics for a consistent thermodynamic description.∎


**5. Boundary Channel Capacity and Capacity-Erasure Balance**

We connect the bulk entropy generation to the information capacity of the boundary, invoking the fundamental limits derived from the ND-RID dynamics governing interactions in the PU framework.

*   **Boundary Channel Capacity $C_{max}$:** As established in PU Appendix E (Theorem E.2), the underlying ND-RID interactions defining the MPU network have a strictly limited classical information capacity $C_{max}$ (in nats, dimensionless) per effective interaction channel or degree of freedom. This capacity is bounded $C_{max} < \ln d_0$ due to the fundamental irreversibility $\varepsilon \ge \ln 2$ (Theorem 31) leading to strict channel contractivity $f_{RID} < 1$ (Lemma E.1). This $C_{max}$ represents the maximum rate at which distinguishable information can be reliably processed or transmitted across any boundary within the network, per effective channel [Holevo 1998; Schumacher & Westmoreland 1997]. We interpret this as the capacity **per boundary link** (associated with area $\ell^2$).

*   **Hypothesis 5.1 (Capacity-Erasure Balance).** For a consistent holographic description arising from the PCE-optimized SPAP-QECC, the classical information capacity $C_{\max}$ available per boundary link must precisely balance the rate density of information erasure occurring in the corresponding bulk wedge. We hypothesize the equality:
    $$
    C_{\max} = c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \ln 2 \quad (5.1)
    $$
*   **Justification:** This hypothesis posits a fundamental consistency condition required by the Principle of Compression Efficiency (PCE). The boundary degrees of freedom, operating at their maximum ND-RID limited capacity $C_{max}$ per link, must be able to fully account for or process the information related to the irreducible erasure events ($k_B \ln 2$ entropy, corresponding to $\ln 2$ nats of information loss per event) occurring in the bulk region they encode ($c_{geom}^{(3D)}$ events per boundary link area $\ell^2$). If $C_{max}$ were less than the erasure rate density, information related to bulk processes would be irretrievably lost at the boundary, violating the QECC property (Assumption 2.2) needed for coherent prediction and potentially leading to inconsistencies penalized by PCE. If $C_{max}$ were greater, it would imply excess capacity, an inefficient use of resources disfavored by PCE. Thus, PCE drives the system towards an equilibrium where the boundary channel capacity matches the irreducible information processing load imposed by the bulk dynamics, leading to the balance expressed in Eq. (5.1). This hypothesis connects the microscopic irreversibility cost ($\ln 2$) to the macroscopic channel limit ($C_{max}$) via the emergent geometry ($c_{geom}^{(3D)}$). We proceed conditional on this hypothesis.


**6. Emergent Planck Length from PU Consistency**

The PU framework provides an independent derivation for the emergent Planck length $L_P^2 = G$ based on the relationship between boundary entropy density and channel capacity. From PU Appendix E (**Equation E.10** in natural units, or the principle leading to **Equation E.7** which relates the microscopic parameter group involving $\sigma_{eff\_link}$ and $C_{max}$ to $1/(4L_P^2)$ when combining the Area Law definition $S = k_B \mathcal{A} / (4L_P^2)$ with the microscopic entropy expression $S_{max} = N_{eff\_links} S_{channel}^{max}$):
$$
\frac{1}{4 L_P^2} = \frac{\sigma_{eff\_link} C_{\max}}{k_B} = \frac{1}{k_B} \left(\frac{\chi}{\eta \ell^2}\right) (k_B C_{\max}) = \frac{\chi C_{\max}}{\eta \ell^2} \quad (6.1)
$$
where $C_{\max}$ is the dimensionless capacity in nats per effective boundary link, $\ell$ is the MPU spacing ($\delta$), and $\eta, \chi$ are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ geometric packing and correlation factors.

**Assumption 6.1 (Ideal Geometric Factors).** For the highly regular SPAP-QECC lattice model considered here, we assume that the emergent structure is sufficiently optimized by PCE such that effective correlations are minimal ($\chi \approx 1$) and the geometric packing relative to the boundary area is ideal ($\eta \approx 1$). This simplification yields $\eta\chi = 1$.
*Justification Note:* This assumption posits that PCE, in driving the system towards geometric regularity (Theorem 43), also optimizes local information transfer efficiency at boundaries, suppressing correlations and non-ideal packing effects that would reduce the effective channel density. It is a simplifying assumption for this model.

Under Assumption 6.1, the PU consistency relation becomes:
$$
\frac{1}{4 L_P^2} = \frac{C_{\max}}{\ell^2} \quad (6.2)
$$
Now, crucially, we substitute the Capacity-Erasure Balance (Hypothesis 5.1, Eq. 5.1) into this PU relation:
$$
\frac{1}{4 L_P^2} = \frac{c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \ln 2}{\ell^2} \quad (6.3)
$$
This equation provides a direct link between the emergent Planck scale $L_P$ (and thus $G$) and the microscopic parameters of the SPAP-QECC model: the fundamental lattice scale $\ell$, the universal SPAP erasure cost $\ln 2$, and the dimensionless geometric factor $c_{geom}^{(3D)}$.



**7. Derivation of the Bekenstein–Hawking Formula**

The final step is to demonstrate the equality between the thermodynamic entropy density calculated from the bulk SPAP erasures (Proposition 4.1) and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density defined via the emergent Planck length determined by Eq. (6.3).

From Proposition 4.1 (Eq. 4.2), the thermodynamic entropy density is:
$$
\frac{S_{therm}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{A}} = \frac{k_B c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \ln 2}{\ell^2} \quad (*)
$$
The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density is universally defined as $S_{BH}/\mathcal{A} = k_B / (4 L_P^2)$. Using Equation (6.3), which fixes $1/(4L_P^2)$ based on Hypothesis 5.1 and Assumption 6.1 within the PU framework:
$$
\frac{S_{BH}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{A}} = k_B \left( \frac{1}{4 L_P^2} \right) = k_B \left( \frac{c_{\text{geom}}^{(3D)} \ln 2}{\ell^2} \right) \quad (**)
$$
Comparing equations (*) and (**), we find they are identical:
$$
\frac{S_{therm}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{A}} = \frac{S_{BH}(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{A}}
$$
Therefore, the total thermodynamic entropy associated with the boundary matches the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:
$$
S_{therm}(\mathcal{A}) = \frac{k_B \mathcal{A}}{4 L_P^2} \quad (7.1)
$$

**Conclusion of Derivation:** We have shown that, conditional on the Capacity-Erasure Balance Hypothesis (Hypothesis 5.1), the assumed existence and properties of the SPAP-QECC (Assumption 2.2), and the assumption of ideal geometric and correlation factors ($\eta\chi=1$, Assumption 6.1), the thermodynamic entropy arising from the fundamental SPAP logical irreversibility within a holographic QECC structure precisely yields the Bekenstein–Hawking Area Law, including the factor of $1/4$. The derivation connects the microscopic cost of self-prediction ($\ln 2$) to macroscopic gravitational entropy via geometric scaling and information-theoretic consistency conditions imposed by the PU framework.


**8. Discussion**

This derivation provides a candidate microscopic explanation for the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Law originating from the core principles of the Predictive Universe framework. It posits that gravitational entropy is fundamentally thermodynamic entropy generated by the irreducible computational cost ($\varepsilon = \ln 2$) associated with the SPAP cycle logic inherent in the underlying MPU substrate, realized within a holographic quantum error-correcting code structure. The factor of $1/4$ emerges naturally from the consistency between the PU framework's definition of the emergent Planck scale (linked to boundary channel capacity $C_{max}$) and the hypothesized equality between this capacity and the density of bulk SPAP erasures.

The derivation's rigor depends critically on establishing the validity of Hypothesis 5.1 (Capacity-Erasure Balance) and Assumption 2.2 (SPAP-QECC Existence/Properties) from more fundamental PU principles or potentially from advances in holographic tensor network theory incorporating dissipation [Almheiri et al. 2015]. Assumption 6.1 ($\eta\chi=1$) represents a simplification for this model, requiring verification or refinement.

Subject to these crucial conditions, the SPAP-QECC model offers a compelling narrative: the fabric of spacetime, emerging from the predictive MPU network, acts like a vast quantum error-correcting code. The thermodynamic cost of the network's fundamental self-predictive processing ($\varepsilon = \ln 2$ per cycle per effective node) manifests as the entropy associated with causal boundaries (horizons), with the relationship dictated by holographic principles [Bousso 2002] and the information capacity limits ($C_{max}$) imposed by the underlying irreversible ND-RID dynamics. This work strongly suggests that the entropy of horizons is directly tied to the fundamental computational and thermodynamic costs of the processes constituting spacetime itself. It provides a concrete mechanism supporting the derivation of the Area Law (Theorem 49) and emergent gravity (Section 12) presented in the main PU paper. Further research is needed to rigorously derive the central Capacity-Erasure Balance hypothesis from POP/PCE optimization principles or demonstrate its necessity for the self-consistency of holographic QECCs with intrinsic dissipation.
