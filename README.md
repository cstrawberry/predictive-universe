## Overview

This project explores the **Predictive Universe (PU)** model, a theoretical framework conceived as a foundational element within the larger artistic and world-building project, Universe 00110000.

Universe 00110000 is envisioned as a digital frontier where imagination and technology intertwine. It aims to construct a simulated reality that is similar to our own.

The Predictive Universe framework presented here serves as a set of underlying operational principles governing this simulated reality. It takes the concept of an information-processing cosmos to a logical conclusion, modeling reality as emerging from interacting predictive units (MPUs) governed by optimization principles and resource constraints. This framework attempts to unify aspects related to quantum mechanics, spacetime geometry, and consciousness from first principles.

**Project Status:** Please note that this is a work-in-progress project. The framework is under continuous development, and its evolution is documented through the project's history. We welcome constructive feedback and engagement as the model matures.


## Project Components

This repository contains two main parts:

1.  **Paper Documentation:** The detailed theoretical framework of the Predictive Universe model is presented in Markdown format in the `docs/paper/` directory. It includes the main text and appendices `docs/paper/appendices/` (files prefixed `appendix_`) detailing core derivations and justifications. The `docs/paper/related/` directory contains supplementary materials exploring concepts connected to the PU framework.
2.  **Conceptual Visualizations:** Interactive conceptual illustrations, built with Three.js and Vite, are located in the `visualization/` directory. These aim to provide intuition for some of the core ideas presented in the paper.

## Reading the Paper

*   Navigate to the `docs/paper/` directory.
*   Read the Markdown files in numerical order, starting with `00_abstract.md`.
*   Appendices `docs/paper/appendices/`: Please note that the appendices are crucial for understanding the detailed derivations and justifications underpinning the framework's core claims.
*   Recommended Viewer: These files are best viewed with a Markdown reader or editor that supports mathematical rendering. Tools like the **Markdown All in One** extension for **VS Code** provide a good reading experience.

## Running the Visualizations (Requires Node.js)

The visualizations provide conceptual illustrations of different stages of the PU framework.

1.  **Prerequisites:** You need Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cstrawberry/predictive-universe
    cd predictive-universe
    ```
3.  **Navigate to Visualization Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd visualization
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will compile the necessary files and start a local development server. It will typically output a URL (like `http://localhost:5173`) in your terminal.

6.  **View in Browser:** Open the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) provided in your terminal in your web browser. **Some development servers might open this for you automatically.**

7.  **Select Stages:** Use the buttons at the top of the visualization page to switch between different conceptual illustrations.

**Disclaimer:** The visualizations involve running JavaScript code fetched from this repository and its dependencies locally. While developed with standard tools, you should always exercise caution when running code from any source. Review the code and dependencies if you have security concerns. Run at your own risk.
